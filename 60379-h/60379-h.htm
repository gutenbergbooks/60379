<h2><a id="Preface"></a>Preface</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> original intention was to collect together
a number of essays on some of the most
important bearings of the question of the
expenditure of riches. After corresponding
with those whom I had invited to join me in
this undertaking, I became aware that in spite
of our substantial agreement on main principles
it would be difficult to secure uniformity in the
treatment of the theme, and impossible to carry
on any sustained argument through the varied
contributions of different people writing from
different points of view. Accordingly I came
to the conclusion that I must renounce the
co-operation of men well qualified to speak,
whose knowledge and experience would have
given their opinions special weight, and work
out my own argument unaided.</p>

<p>Had I approached the subject from the
standpoint of a scientific economist, I should
have hesitated to enter upon such a formidable
task. The more special knowledge a man has,
the more conscious does he become of the impossibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of dealing adequately with his subject.
But my object has been to write as one knowing
no more than others who take any interest in
human affairs and watch the play of social forces,
as one who is no spectator in the combat he
describes, and who, being himself infected with
the malady he is studying, is perhaps the better
able to diagnose it. I do not speak as a preacher
to his congregation, as a teacher to his pupils,
as a moralist to his disciples, or even as a politician
to his audience, but as one man submitting his
opinion for what it is worth to another.</p>

<p>At the same time, I am compelled by a deep
conviction in the truth of my argument which
passing years and the course of events only serve
to strengthen, and if, by the brief suggestions
contained in these pages, I can succeed in inducing
anyone to examine more closely this branch
of the Social Problem, which in my opinion is
too often dismissed as negligible, I shall be
amply repaid.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to those who have kindly
assisted me in collecting the facts and figures in
Chapter VIII and in other parts of the book, and
also to Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Hammond, who read
through the MS. and made valuable criticisms
and suggestions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Frederick the Great’s</span> father, on the
occasion of great court festivities used to
lead his wife from the brilliant scene of gaiety
to an adjoining chamber, where he made her lie
down for a few moments in her own coffin, so as
to give her a sharp reminder of the vanity and
transitory nature of all human pleasure. An even
more effective reminder for those who in London
spend their money on a life of pure self-indulgence
would be afforded by a walk at midnight along
the Embankment from Westminster to Waterloo
Bridge. No prearranged stage management is
necessary for the sight they are to see. It is a
long run, every night and all night, and has gone
on ever since the Embankment was constructed.
As they pass along they can see the seats packed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
closely with men and women leaning against one
another in an exhausted or half-drunken slumber.
They can see the ragged and filthy bundles of
humanity lying round the parapet at the foot of
Cleopatra’s Needle, or the rows of wretched
caricatures of men and women lined along the
wall under the shelter of the bridges. If they
go late enough, there is a strange silence which
at first gives the impression that the place is
deserted. But it only means that these waifs and
strays, these wretched outcasts, are enjoying the
few hours’ reprieve given even to them by the
blessed oblivion of sleep. The moon shines on
them from over the river, but no melodrama
can reproduce that scene; estimates are drawn
up of their number, but no statistics can give
an adequate analysis; books are written on their
condition, but no language can describe it. A
man who sees this squalid throng for the first
time must be deeply impressed, but it strikes
even more anyone who sees it constantly, and
he must be less than human if he can pass without
a poignant pang of shame. But nine out of
ten of those who do pass along will tell you
these wretches only have themselves to blame,
and it would be better if they could be stowed
away somewhere out of sight.</p>

<p>This, which is only one of many similar scenes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
throughout the country, is not described by way
of presenting a dramatic contrast, but as an integral
part of the problem of riches. These
nocturnal spectres of the Embankment and the
knots of bedraggled starvelings at the workhouse
gates are the counterpart of the millionaire, the
necessary concomitant to balance and complete
the picture. The shameful waste of money one
end produces a shameful waste of human life the
other end. One species of parasite on the social
body breeds another species of parasite. They
are as much a part of the train of a rich man as
his butlers and gamekeepers. They are the
natural, though perhaps to him invisible, consequence
of his misapplied and squandered thousands.
The rich must take their full share of the
responsibility, because the wealth represented by
growing incomes is being increasingly ill-directed
and wasted, and the inevitable outcome is to
aggravate the problem of unemployment, to extend
still further miserable conditions of living,
and to nurture a neglected class devoid of moral
and physical stamina, who fall out as incompetents
and wastrels in the great struggle for existence.
There are some who complain of any relief from
the State being given to the unemployed poor as
only encouraging their continued existence; but
the maintenance of the unemployed rich by those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
who are instrumental in producing the national
wealth is a far graver question. The unemployed
pauper is a deplorable, but in each case a solitary
and isolated outgrowth of circumstances too
strong for him to resist. Whereas the unemployed
capitalist is, on account of his riches, the
centrifugal point of a whole set of dynamic
forces of the gravest consequence. They radiate
from him, vibrate far and wide into the vital
concerns of others, and continue to operate
harmfully so long as he attempts to manipulate
his riches single-handed. He constitutes, therefore,
a social danger.</p>

<p>This is no place to give a picture of poverty.
It has been done often enough of late years and
with faithful accuracy, so that society has no
excuse for ignoring the real state of affairs, though
in their stampede after money they have little
time to give it a passing thought. To reflect
about it and speak of it is to display foolish
pessimism; to describe scenes of poverty is to
be guilty of sentimentality and bad taste.</p>

<p>And what are the prevailing sentiments of the
fat parasites towards their lean colleagues?
Either pity or contempt. Their whole faith and
all their actions naturally breed contempt for
poverty, although they make some effort to conceal
it. It is quite in consonance with a belief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
that money makes people refined, generous,
dignified, gracious, subjects of reverence and
models for emulation, and that those who have
no resources cannot aspire to these notable qualities.
But their pity, which is the mainspring to
their so-called charity and is reserved more
especially for the destitute, is misplaced, and
would be better applied to themselves if only
they could see the true position they fill in the
general design of human society.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Epargnez aux pauvres votre pitié,” says
Anatole France, “ils n’en ont que faire. Pourquoi
la pitié et non pas la justice? Vous êtes en
compte avec eux. Réglez le compte. Ce n’est
pas une affaire de sentiment. C’est une affaire
économique. Si ce que vous leur donnez gracieusement
est pour prolonger leur pauvreté et
votre richesse, ce don est inique et les larmes que
vous y mêlerez ne le rendront pas équitable....
Vous faites l’aumône pour ne pas restituer. Vous
donnez un peu pour garder beaucoup et vous
vous félicitez. Ainsi le tyran de Samos jeta son
anneau à la mer. Mais la Némésis des dieux ne
reçut point cette offrande. Un pêcheur rapporta
au tyran son anneau dans le ventre d’un
poisson. Et Polycrate fut dépouillé de toutes
ses richesses.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Together with the pity there is a lurking misgiving
that they do owe the poor something, so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
in blind ignorance and in fear of the full amount
of their debt being demanded of them, they pay
out driblets either with ostentation and self-congratulation
or else trying almost pathetically,
yet in vain, to pump into their gifts some of the
sentiments which they conceive should be associated
with pure charity.</p>

<p>As for those whose incomes fall below the
limit, the money ideal affects them just as
strongly as it does the rich themselves. There
is more excuse because there is a greater want of
education; there is more excuse also because,
knowing from their own experience that money
can keep off starvation and prevent the physical
suffering produced by want, and knowing also
that more money means more comforts and a
wider scope for activity, they fall naturally into
the error of believing that every progressive increase
in money brings a proportionate increase
in happiness. The large mass whose incomes are
the wrong side of the limit are all of them in
want in various degrees, and their desire for
more money is therefore legitimate and only to
be expected. The want of it they know by experience
means misery, the possession of it they
conclude must mean happiness. But they are
seldom, if ever, taught that they can frustrate
their own ends by pinning their whole faith on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
purely material acquisition; on the contrary,
the general opinion round them leads them to
suppose that money should rightly be the sole
aim and object of their ambitions. The education,
if it can be called by that name, which they
receive from the cheap press presents them with
inviting pictures of wealth, ease, and luxury.
They read of men who have amassed great fortunes,
of incidents in the careers of millionaires,
of charitable gifts bestowed by the munificent
rich, of the positions, success, titles, and fame
achieved by men through money. Their eye
falls on alluring advertisements for expensive
goods. They are encouraged to bet and gamble,
and to enter absurd competitions made attractive
by the figures of a large sum of money being
printed in bold type at the head of the newspaper
column. Their appetite is whetted, their
wants increase, they resolve to try and make
more money by the swiftest means possible. Any
ideal of service and any noble ambitions for
achievement fade away, and are discarded as too
laborious and difficult and as requiring too much
effort and toil. If they have actually suffered in
the lowest depths, if they have ever felt the sharp
pinch of starvation, the more readily do they
accept the doctrine preached to them so loudly
and so persistently that to become rich is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
only the highest, but the most practical and
sensible ambition for a man to set himself.</p>

<p>Tantalising rewards lead a man on to hurry
blindly along a path beset with traps and snares.
On the various stages of his journey he loses
some of the finer qualities with which he may
have been originally endowed, but which he finds
impediments and encumbrances in his progress
towards the inviting but illusive goal. Here he
drops caution, there self-respect, here consideration
for others must be sacrificed; there, again,
scrupulousness and even honesty must be cast
aside. The man who “rises,” who “makes his
pile,” who “succeeds,” goes up the ladder of
wealth, the rungs of which are vanity and applause,
mistaking it for the ladder of life, the
rungs of which are service, sacrifice, and resolution.
There are bags of gold at the top within
sight; it matters not that some of the rungs are
dangerously weak. Others have reached the top
or near it, why should not he?</p>

<p>Every step forward is marked by outward
signs and changes. The cottage with its simple
adornments is exchanged for the villa with its
walnut suites and art knickknacks; this is followed
by a larger detached villa which requires several
servants; the dogcart and groom-gardener are
soon transformed into a motor-car and chauffeur;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the male servant with livery adds the necessary
importance; the butler becomes indispensable
for the town residence, with a country seat as
well for shooting and entertainment; and so on,
more and more display until the ultimate goal
is reached, with, strange to say, no real satisfaction
or contentment. New friends are made
on the road and old friends are dropped. Each
advance signifies a fresh endeavour to live in the
same style as those on the next higher level, with
whom it becomes a duty to associate. Meanwhile
the man’s powers of digestion and those of
his family do not increase, nor does their mental
equipment. Even his capacity for enjoyment he
finds has its limits and appears to become further
restricted. But he knows he will be judged, even
as he has judged others, by the quantity and
quality of his worldly possessions, and he follows
obediently the model and example the rich have
set up. There are some who see the emptiness
of this course; there are some who have the
character not to desire to alter the way of living
to which they have been accustomed; but are
there any who would condemn the accumulation
of riches and resist the incessant temptations
that are put in their way of making more?</p>

<p>When the poor man, with a bare living wage,
fails to keep a decent home, drinks, or spends his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
money foolishly, he is ruthlessly condemned as
thriftless and intemperate. But who is setting
him the example of thrift and abstemiousness?
Anyhow, not the rich man, to whom the very
words are meaningless. If he drops out from
incompetence, from weakness, or from viciousness,
if destitution becomes his lot, his nature
becomes crippled, his character warped, his mind
embittered, and he finds himself dragged down
lower still and trodden under by his fellow-men
in their thoughtless and brutal stampede for
lucre. Truly, “the destruction of the poor is
their poverty.” The general pressure of the
multitude is downward and destructive, not because
there is any inherent depravity in their
nature, either individually or collectively, but
because of the narrow confines of the course into
which they are driven and because of the oppression
to which they are subjected. There is no
time to stop, pick up, and shield those who have
started on the journey with the hideous handicap
of disease and incompetence created by degraded
and disgraceful homes; these unfortunates must
go to the wall, because the potential energy and
pressure of society is not concentrated on the uplifting
of the feeble and the recovery of the outcasts,
but on the rush forward with the rich in
the forefront as leaders—a desperate rush towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
some seductive dream of prosperity, some
purely selfish satisfaction of animal appetites and
material pleasures. The slow and often discouraging
expedients of relief, restoration, and
help are passed over when success, conquest, and
triumph are in sight.</p>

<p>A plutocracy may not ever actually govern the
country; a greater calamity could hardly be
conceived, but the rich are, nevertheless, our
leaders, and every rich man is setting up a pattern
which, without his being aware of it, perhaps
hundreds of thousands are anxious to copy. The
poor admire and like the rich, and the rich know
it. In their humility, and sometimes envy, they
watch them with awe as beings of another and
more glorious world. They read of them in their
novelettes; an atmosphere of splendour and
romance surrounds them. They see them in
their brilliant settings, they hear of their great
doings, they know of the magnificence of their
establishments, and as the chasm between them
is still unbridged, they are spellbound by the
fascination which only the mysterious and the
unknowable can give. They see no connection
whatsoever between the position of the rich and
their own, nor do the rich themselves acknowledge
that there is any. The ignorance of the
rich about the poor is profound, but it is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
to the ignorance of the poor about the rich. The
chasm between the two is never spanned. Those
who live with the rich approve their methods and
are blind to sights they do not want to see.
They are heedless and unconscious of the world
of toil and privation, or only apprehend it occasionally
when a beggar or tramp somehow manages
to evade being tucked away out of sight
and thrusts himself before their unwilling gaze.
Even then they become accustomed to the sight
of these unfortunates, whose existence they believe
is due to the bad management of public
authorities. And those who study the far side
of the chasm are so much preoccupied and aghast
at the tangled confusion that confronts them
that they only have time to cast a glance of contempt
at the self-indulgence and luxurious living
which seems too distant to be real, too ridiculous
and wicked to be quite true, and they refuse to
regard it seriously as a component part of the
various enigmas they are attempting to solve.
Even economists, who are occupied with dissertations
and discussions on production, consumption,
and distribution, seldom turn their attention
seriously to the moral impulses that cause, and
the fashions and habits that control, the great
accumulations of capital and the appalling waste
which results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
A writer, describing the state of the country
in 1851,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> declared that the great social evil of
the time was “the separation between the rich
and poor, the dis-sympathy of classes, the mutual
disgust which appears to threaten some sort of
violent revolution in society at no very distant
period.” But when he goes on to describe what
he considers to be the desirable relationship, he
says, “What one wants to see is a kind and
cordial condescension on the one side, and an
equally cordial but still respectful devotedness on
the other.” Luckily there are now many more
people than there were at that date who know
this to be as ridiculous as it is impossible. But
there are still, unfortunately, a good many whose
ideas this singularly naïve opinion faithfully
represents.</p>

<p>This “dis-sympathy” will amount to something
very much more like class hatred whenever
the poor begin to open their eyes. It is a mistake
to suppose that antagonism between classes is
produced by the inflammatory speeches and
writings of agitators. The masses herded into
our towns to become miserably poor, unemployed
and unemployable, rapidly lose all self-respect,
and are too much stupefied and even
brutalised by their condition to be alive to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
injustice of our social system or to seek to attack
those whom they suspect are responsible. They
are dumb, cowed, and easily driven. “Sweat
the poor,” says an anonymous writer in 1892, infuriated
by the injustice of things, “sweat the
poor and grind their faces and accumulate
wealth—only let us have no cant about it.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
It is the rich as a class who, by their manner of
life, by their refusal to undertake most of the
patent responsibilities of citizenship, by their
squandering of the national capital, and by their
determination to suck up from the labour of
others sufficient to allow them to live in idleness
themselves, it is they that help to find the fuel
for the flame of class hatred, a flame which one
day may burst out into a mighty conflagration.</p>

<p>A Canadian journalist, writing on his recent
visit to this country, has declared that it was not
“the statesmen or pro-consuls or heroes or
scholars” or our great historic institutions that
left the most abiding memories. “Frankly, the
thing that impressed me most, the thing that
stands out as the background of every reminiscence,
was the bloodless, mirthless, hopeless face
of the common crowd ... the social problem
everywhere is appalling, almost to the point of
despair. Wherever we went it forced itself upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
us. The least dangerous aspect of it was that
hollow-eyed procession of the homeless of London
kept moving along the pavements by the police
in the early dawn waiting for the opening of the
soup kitchens.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> And he speaks in the same
way of Sheffield, Manchester, Glasgow, and
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The last hundred years will be memorable as an
era of almost miraculous advance in all that concerns
material progress. And yet we have to
admit, as the Report of the Poor Law Commission
shows, that so far as pauperism and destitution
are concerned our attempts at cure and
prevention have completely failed. Here again
we find the same <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fons et origo malorum</i>. Every
step forward in methods of production, in new
inventions and improved machinery, is a tangible
material gain for some one. But in the case of
the pauper, be he veteran, invalid, incompetent,
or child, there is nothing that can be transformed
into immediate profit. There is no <em>money</em> in it.
Therefore it has been impossible to rouse the
public sympathy and interest. Fortunately many
are now beginning to see that the prevention of
neglect and waste in human life means wealth to
the nation that cannot be estimated in sums of
money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
The problem of social reorganisation is one of
the greatest complexity.</p>

<p>Drink and slum dwellings doubtless aggravate
the evil and make bad worse. The land and our
system of industrial organisation are the regulating
forces that drive our population into these
hideous social conditions. But it is time we
traced back these forces to their source and
examined their origin.</p>

<p>What is it that induces a great people to
arrange their society on this uneconomic, wasteful,
and life-destroying model? What common
impulses inspire the class that is in authority and
command to support and maintain such a system?
Put on one side tyranny, rapacity, greed, and
covetousness, which are vices that no one wants
to defend. What is at the back of this thirst
for huge profits and high dividends, this capture
of the land, this amassing of great possessions,
this passion for pleasure, this love of power and
patronage, this respect for wealth, this subservience
to riches?</p>

<p>Lurking in the spring head, far away from the
broad river, we shall find the poison that is
polluting the waters—our devouring, indestructible,
overpowering belief in money.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">Money as a supreme concern—Intensity of belief in money—Definition
of Contention—The impulses which act as the
motive power of money-making—The limitation of human
capacities—Money and happiness—Money as responsibility—The

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Religion</span> is said to be one of the supreme
concerns of the human race, and there
can be no doubt that it forces itself into the
calculations of every one of us. It is a matter
about which we fight and differ, about which
we interest ourselves in various degrees in proportion
to the development of our spiritual and
emotional nature, and which only a minority
conscientiously consider to be of vital consequence.
But there is another concern which enters
equally surely into all our calculations, for which
we fight without differing, about which we
interest ourselves in various degrees in proportion
to the development of our material nature,
and which only a small minority consider <em>not</em> to
be of vital consequence. After the satisfaction
of our animal appetites it is our first preoccupation.
To some it presents itself as the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
first consideration on which even the satisfaction
of their appetites must depend. All great
human efforts at progress, whether they issue
from religious, political, scientific, social, or
economic sources, get checked and thwarted
sooner or later, because of the universal acceptance
of a dominant principle, so powerful and so
insinuating that it permeates the views and convictions
of men, whether they be of high or low
degree, and irrespective of their creed and
nationality. This bond that unites all civilised
humanity is not a great uplifting ideal nor a
divine inspiration. It has more the nature of a
malignant and infectious disease by which we
are all contaminated. It can be expressed in
one single and familiar word—<span class="smcap smaller">MONEY</span>—that is to
say the unqualified belief in money as a means,
money as an end, aim, object, ideal; money as
representing the method of securing a greater
degree of physical wellbeing, money as power,
money as pleasure, money, therefore, as happiness.
It is a deep-rooted and at present ineradicable
conviction which we hold without doubt and
without question. A little money, we argue, is
obviously indispensable, a little more money we
are all of us continually declaring that we want, a
good deal of money we are convinced brings a
decided increase in happiness, and a vast amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
of money must therefore mean a great power for
good.</p>

<p>This belief, which amounts almost to an
instinct, may vary in intensity, it may cloak
itself under many insidious disguises, but it is
very rarely if ever completely absent. It takes
all conceivable forms, from undisguised greed to
simulated contempt. There are those who devote
their lives to amassing more money; there are
those who, having sufficient, assume outwardly
an indifference as to its power, while they retain
inwardly a profound and unwavering faith in it;
and there are those who struggle for it so as to
avoid social and sometimes even actual death
from need of it. It insinuates itself into the
minds of men who have no confidence in material
advancement because they find that our whole
social system is based on this belief, and if they
do not want to be left behind in the struggle
they must accept the creed.</p>

<p>Not only by individuals separately, but by
the people collectively it is accepted as a concern
of supreme importance. Our lives, our marriages,
and therefore our very birth are regulated
by it, our occupations, our industries and our
arts, everything but death depends on it, and
even death itself can be hastened or postponed
by it. So national is the reverence for it that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
our holidays are not fixed on saints’ days, or to
commemorate episodes from the rich part of our
history, but they are <em>Bank</em> holidays. The closing
of our banks is the one signal that for twenty-four
hours we are free.</p>

<p>The multifarious aspects of the theme are
most bewildering. As Sir Henry Taylor said,
“So manifold are the bearings of money upon
the lives and character of mankind, that an
insight which should search out the life of a man
in his pecuniary relations would penetrate into
almost every cranny of his nature. For if we take
account of all the virtues with which money is
mixed up, honesty, justice, charity, frugality,
forethought, self-sacrifice, and of their correlative
vices, it is a knowledge that goes near to
cover the length and breadth of humanity.”</p>

<p>It is certainly true that the amazingly extensive
nature of the subject might lead one away
into perfectly relevant discussions of almost
every field of human activity; and nothing renders
argument so unsatisfactory and inconclusive
as to have unlimited scope. But in these pages
the issue must be narrowed down and the question
confined so far as possible to a very brief
examination of one particular aspect of the
subject, which will be created by formulating a
deliberate contention and pursuing it by argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
into some of the main channels of this
perplexing problem. Even so it is likely that
deep water will be reached, but, after all, a
suggestion need not be driven to its utmost
limits in all directions in order to establish its
significance.</p>

<p>In choosing a direct point of attack against
this generally accepted belief we shall treat the
matter more or less from a practical point of
view. Without getting involved in abstract
philosophic propositions, without entering too
far into the sphere of economics and politics,
without preaching high morality, though the
words and teachings of preachers must be quoted,
an endeavour will be made, by working out a
definite line of reasoning, to submit as a whole
some of the simpler and perhaps more personal
considerations which have no doubt already
occurred to many who have given the subject
thought and reflection. No maxims will be laid
down as to how money should be made, spent,
saved, lent, borrowed, invested, given or bequeathed,
for the object is to strike at the root
principle and shatter the ideal which underlies
all those transactions, which colours men’s characters,
influences their desires and aspirations,
creates artificial class contrasts, and contributes
largely to the general social confusion and chaos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Briefly, then, our contention is: <em>That no
individual is capable of possessing, spending, or
administering more than a certain definite amount
of money, which can be roughly described as a full
competence, without producing positively harmful
effects on himself as well as on those affected by his
actions.</em> In other words, the “rich man” is an
impossibility in any decently organised economic
State, and the accumulation of capital in individual
hands is detrimental to the public good.
That is what is meant by the saying from which
the title of this volume is taken.</p>

<p>It may appear at first sight to be an extreme
view, because we have got so much accustomed
to believing that a great deal of good can be done
with money, and a great deal of happiness derived
from it, that to be confronted with an uncompromising
negation on such a time-honoured
tradition may seem almost absurd. The argument
is purposely intended to be completely
comprehensive, and a case will be presented
without exaggeration which will cover as much
of the ground as possible, dealing with typical
rather than exceptional instances by way of
illustration.</p>

<p>We find in human nature three characteristic
impulses which serve as the mainspring and
motive power in the gaining and spending of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
money: the passion for acquisition, the instinct
for absolute property, and the desire to excel.
No one would suggest that the passion for
acquisition can be destroyed: it is neither
possible nor desirable, but it can be prevented
from running wild, and it can be controlled,
though it does not seem to have occurred to many
people that such control is expedient. The
instinct for absolute property is very much overestimated,
and this arises from the fact that we
are accustomed to a system which hardly allows
any satisfactory intermediate stage between
property and positive need. The craving for
complete possession on any considerable scale
only enters into the minds of those who covet
their neighbours’ possessions. What a man
wants and has every right to expect is security
in the enjoyment of his necessaries and comforts,
but this is precisely what in the vast majority of
cases he does not get; and his want remaining
unsatisfied is converted into a craving for absolute
property. The desire to excel, which can
undoubtedly be one of the finest human qualities,
is in itself vitiated by the measure of money,
which sets up an utterly false standard of excellence
and converts pure ambition into a desire
for material pre-eminence.</p>

<p>However far we may travel, the problem will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
be continually resolving itself into some variation
of the question as to how these impulses
had best be regulated, and to what extent they
have broken out beyond their legitimate bounds.
But although the causes of the faith in money
may be reduced to moral and psychological terms,
there are economic as well as moral results, and
it is not the metaphysical origins, but the practical
results which must be looked into.</p>

<p>At the outset we must acknowledge that our
capacities of all kinds are strictly limited, whether
moral, intellectual, or physical. An occasional
saint, an occasional genius, or an occasional giant
stretches the limit beyond its normal point, but the
limit still remains. And yet we are foolish enough
to believe that in regard to the possession, expenditure,
and administering of riches there is no sum
of money, however large, which we are not competent
to deal with, and we are convinced that it is
quite easy and unquestionably within the capacity
of almost anyone to spend with benefit to himself
and to others sums of money greatly in
excess of what can cover in the widest sense
his personal requirements. Whereas not only
is it not easy, but as inquiry will show, it is purely
and positively impossible, as impossible as it is
to acquire vast knowledge with a limited brain
capacity, or to endure more than a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
amount of physical strain with a limited muscular
capacity. We are inclined also to think
that men who have money and men who make
money are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> easily capable of spending
the money properly, though we generally make
the mental reservation that if we had it ourselves
we should spend it a great deal better.
But the inheritance or accumulation of money
does not imply by any means a special ability
for spending it wisely. To put it plainly, such
men have not, nor have we, nor has anyone this
ability except in a very limited degree, far more
limited than is generally supposed or ever
admitted.</p>

<p>The case against riches has been argued again
and again on religious and moral grounds for
over two thousand years, from Confucius to
Tolstoy. But we are less impressed by the truth
of it now than ever we were; and we still hear
it stated by high authorities that it is a benefit
to the community to contain men of great
wealth. The whole delusion arises from the
indestructible confidence in what money can do.
And yet all of us see clearly enough by the
roughest and most general observation that
happiness does not increase with riches, that
money indeed has very little to do with happiness,
though it has a good deal to do with misery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
But many of us are inclined to believe that our
own individual case is rather different, and that
more money added to our ample competence,
and a consequent further enjoyment of material
possessions, must undoubtedly make us happier.
And when we have got the more and the desired
result is not attained, we never pause in hesitation
to consider whether perhaps the more has
interfered with rather than augmented our
happiness, but we are persuaded that the reason
we find ourselves still discontented is simply
that the more is not enough. Enough never
comes to those who have encouraged the longing
for more. Nothing short of actual experience
can help to eradicate this belief, but there are
few who would care to embark on an experiment
in the direction of less. And yet it could quite
well be demonstrated that a reduction of income,
provided always that the loss does not reduce the
income below a competence can lead to an increase
in happiness—happiness being, of course,
distinguished from pleasure.</p>

<p>It may require a very rare philosophic resignation
and an equally rare breadth of view to
refuse to be deluded into regarding the possession
of money as an absolute essential. Moreover,
there are a great many qualifications to be taken
into account arising from natural characteristics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
habit, temperament, and tastes. But broadly
speaking, if a man has the courage to regard a
reduction of income not as a loss but a gain, if he
can use the opportunity to kill the instinctive
but disturbing craving for more which unfortunately
seems engrained in us all, in fact, if he can
eradicate the germ of the disease, the limitation
of his desire to satisfy transient and what are
really artificial needs will certainly increase his
power of enjoyment and his happiness. On the
other hand, if he treats the lowering of his means
as a calamity, which is the usual case, lamenting
his fate, railing against fortune and encouraging
the longing for gain—an attitude of mind which
is only the outcome of his unlimited faith in the
power of money—the result, naturally enough,
will be despair.</p>

<p>But it might be shown as well that a type
of man does exist, exceptional no doubt, who,
being capable of spending without hurt to himself
or to others more money than he has actually
got, can enrich his life in the broadest sense by an
increase of fortune, and may therefore become
the happier for it. He is a man who is indifferent
to the enjoyment of material possessions and
probably would be regarded in the eyes of the
world as the last man who was competent to use
money properly. But even he would be entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
overwhelmed by anything like a large increase
of fortune, and would be as incapable as any
one else of disposing of it without inflicting
injury.</p>

<p>“Could not riches be used well?” asks Jean
Marie in Stevenson’s <cite>Treasure of Franchard</cite>.</p>

<p>“In theory, yes,” replied the doctor. “But
it is found in experience that no one does so.
All the world imagine they will be exceptional
when they grow wealthy; but possession is
debasing, new desires spring up, and the silly
taste for ostentation eats out the heart of pleasure.”</p>

<p>Money is, after all, responsibility and nothing
else. We are all of us capable of undertaking
a certain amount. Some of us are capable of
undertaking a good deal. No one is capable of
undertaking more than a relatively limited
amount. But the trouble is that most of us
think ourselves capable of undertaking far more
than we properly can. Autocrats are ceasing
to exist not so much because certain monarchs
proved themselves dangerously incapable, but
because the world has learned that no conceivable
human being has the capacity to rule a
country single-handed. We do not yet admit
this incapacity with regard to the autocrats over
capital, although it is equally true, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
we do so we shall find considerable difficulty in
dethroning them.</p>

<p>Another important inference to be deduced
from the argument here set forth is that the
surplus money which no individual does or can
spend beneficially remains in his hands in
stagnant unproductivity, is deflected from other
remunerative channels, and is therefore the
chief cause of the existence of some of the
gravest economic ills which we have to face in
our social life. Money cannot rest, it is an active
instrument for producing good or for producing
evil. Its presence in one quarter may not produce
visible evil, but its <em>consequent</em> absence in
another quarter will produce very visible and
very positive evil. The word consequent must
be emphasised because wealth is like water—to
pump it up artificially on one side is to lower it
automatically on the other.</p>

<p>Money in its character of potential wealth
seems also to have this peculiar characteristic.
It has no positive value in itself. The greater
part of its value is given to it by its possessor,
and in proportion as it accumulates in the hands
of an individual its value is rapidly depreciated.
An electric current of a certain power will perform
certain specified functions. Decrease the
power and it ceases to produce the required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
effect. Increase the power tenfold or a hundredfold
and you will be no nearer achieving the
desired result. That is to say, in addition to the
change in value effected by the change in individual
ownership, there is actual deterioration,
produced by accumulation, whoever the individual
may be who is responsible for that accumulation.</p>

<p>As with individuals, so with the State. National
wealth, which in the highest sense of the word
means the enrichment of the lives of the people,
depends not on how large a number of incomes
there are of over ten thousand a year, but on
how small a number there are of under two
hundred a year. The real riches of a nation are
not to be measured by vast calculations of
commercial statistics, but by the absence of
destitution and the high level of healthy life
which the people enjoy.</p>

<p>But we must accept the situation as it is. The
rich have got their riches, and the problem
to be considered here is not how to deprive
them of their riches, but how to prevent all men,
rich and poor alike, from confiding blindly in
money, as they do at present, and from striving
towards a false ideal which spoils their highest
endeavours, blunts their moral susceptibilities,
poisons their happiness, and produces a state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
social disorder which is highly prejudicial to the
common good. A just appreciation of the
essential fact that money can only be made out
of people’s labour and the wear and tear of
their lives would in itself do much to prevent
the growth of the spirit which leads to these
alarming contrasts in riches and poverty. But
men’s ideals and their moral outlook can only be
altered in the long run by repeatedly exposing
the actual fallacies in the views they now hold
and constantly emphasising the disastrous results
of the actions for which this waste of money is
responsible.</p>

<h2><a id="Chapter_III"></a>Chapter III</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">Definition of the limit—Those whose means are above the limit—Income
translated into terms of subsistence—The case of the
rich man—His establishments—His servants—His luxuries—Extravagance—Vanity—Sport—Racing—Yachting—Condemnation
of excess.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A more</span> precise definition must be given of
the limit of income referred to in the last
chapter as “a definite amount of money which
might be roughly described as a full competence.”</p>

<p>Every man requires, though he by no means
always gets a certain income to satisfy his own
needs and those of his family. In addition to
this he can profitably spend more so as to add to
his general utility by conveniences and comforts,
he can satisfy his artistic proclivities, his desire
for further knowledge, his taste for sport or
amusement, all to his own and the general
benefit without hurt or hindrance to anyone.
But after allowing the broadest scope for the
satisfaction of these legitimate wants there is a
definite point beyond which he cannot safely go.
That is to say, if he acquires, or if by inheritance
he finds himself burdened with money beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
this limit it will inevitably react detrimentally
on himself and on others. And this for two
reasons: firstly because he is, as a normal human
being, incapable of dealing with so great a charge,
and secondly because the money, while in his
possession, is being drawn away from other
channels where there is special need for it.</p>

<p>So long as money encourages healthy effort a
man may be sure the limit has not been reached,
the moment money tends to relax effort the
limit has been passed. It must be described as
healthy effort, as, of course, money-making may
increase the undesirable efforts of the speculator,
the gambler, and the thief. But who is to decide
what is healthy effort? The man himself. No
one else can. And he knows to a nicety. Every
man or woman has a different standard, and the
level of the limit varies in each individual case
according to ideals, capacity, and temperament.
But it will not depend at all on what is one of the
strongest and often the most excusable inducements
for spending money, namely, environment,
or the conventions of the particular stratum of
society to which the man belongs. The limit
for one will not be the limit for another, and a
man can only become aware that this limit exists
at all by observing very closely what actually
is the effect that his money is having on his life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
and character, instead of blindly accepting his
already excessive income or every increase of his
fortune as a natural and unquestionable blessing.</p>

<p>The main brunt of the attack must clearly fall
on those whose incomes are above the limit.
They are in numbers a small minority, but the
amount they possess is incredibly large. The
present income of 1,250,000 people, assessed
to income, reaches the vast sum of £850,000,000
a year. Taking the whole population of these
islands, it is roughly estimated that there are 1½
millions who can be classed as rich, 3½ millions
comfortably off, 38 millions as poor, of whom
some 12 to 13 millions are in constant need. The
existence of the 1½ millions is one of the chief
causes of the condition of the 38 millions. In
other words, excess above the limit causes want
below the limit. The 3½ millions “comfortably
off” are most of them occupied in trying to
become identified with the select 1½ millions.
If we could estimate the amounts in income
which these classes represent the figures would
be even more startling. The world has certainly
never seen larger fortunes than exist to-day, nor
has it seen more extensive and more inexcusable
poverty. The average rate of luxurious living
in the small minority is higher than it has ever
been, and the dangerous and degrading effect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
want on individuals and on the general community
has never been so widespread or so intense.
“The rich,” to use a simple term, are nearly all
actuated by the same motive. They accept what
they have and what they make as their own, to
be spent on themselves, according to their own
caprice, or on others, if they are so inclined, casting
an occasional sop to some charity or philanthropic
scheme as a salve to their consciences.
There are, it must be acknowledged, a few, a
very few who regard their riches as a trust and
endeavour to the best of their ability to divert
the greater part of it back into remunerative
channels without exceeding a reasonable sum
for their own personal wants. But as a class they
insist that efforts to alter our social system are
fruitless, disturbing and doomed to failure, the
division of the world into rich and poor being
a Providential decree, and if the rich can get
service from the poor without their grumbling,
that is the most desirable arrangement that can
be conceived. To this a reply may be given in
the words of Professor Marshall:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Now at least we are setting ourselves seriously
to inquire whether it is necessary that there
should be any so-called ‘lower class’ at all:
that is whether there need be large numbers of
people doomed from their birth to hard work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
in order to provide for others the requisites of a
refined and cultured life, while they themselves
are prevented by their poverty and toil from
having any share in that life.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The case would not be quite so bad as it is
if it were only “the requisites of a refined and
cultured life” that they were made to provide.
But this point must be considered later.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate fully the responsibility
which the possession of riches entails, let us
translate an income into terms of actual sustenance
for human beings. By this means it is
possible to arrive at a more or less positive
measure. There is so much that is relative
in most human requirements that they cannot
serve as a standard or as a reliable quantity
to be used in calculating any equation. But the
requirements of a human being can be measured
in terms of actual sustenance, because they can be
estimated with something approaching precision.</p>

<p>Take a man with £20,000 a year, and say we
deduct even as much as £3000 for himself and
his family. With his remaining £17,000 he has
the power of furnishing 170 people with £100
a year apiece. It is not for a moment suggested
that he should do any such thing, as he would
be quite unable to select 170 worthy people, and
even if he could make the choice the 170 people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
on the reception of this private dole, would soon
become unworthy. This calculation is only
taken to serve as a measure of his power. What
might be the income or, more correctly speaking,
the means of existence of 170 lives, is vested in
one man, who is under the impression—and no
one attempts to dispute it—that he is capable of
disposing of this sum in a way that is generally
beneficial.</p>

<p>Now let us state the case fairly from the point
of view of the rich man, taking a reasonable and
more or less representative type. He may have
£10,000, £50,000, or £100,000 a year—that only
alters his activities in scope, not in quality. Let
us say he has two or three country houses and a
house in London. His “position” requires him
to keep up a certain establishment, and this
means the employment of some forty or fifty
servants, grooms, gardeners, chauffeurs, etc., who,
he readily tells you, will be thrown out of employment
should any of his money be taken from
him. If we take the case of a landlord, he will
also have tenants, bailiffs, farm labourers, and
gamekeepers dependent on him. He keeps the
home farm and lets out the other farms on his
estate to tenant farmers. Part of his land is
built over and brings him in substantial returns
in the shape of rent. His villages are in good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
order and the cottages kept in proper repair.
Some thousands of acres or so he keeps for
shooting. He may have a deer forest on one of
his estates, and perhaps also a grouse moor or a
river. Whether he keeps a racing stable, a pack
of hounds, or a yacht depends on his particular
fancy. He will acknowledge that he spends a
certain amount on luxuries, but that “is good
for trade,” as great numbers of people have to
be employed in the manufacture of these luxuries.
He is kind to his poor relations, whom he
entertains and helps; and his subscription list to
hospitals, charities, and philanthropic works is a
large one. He enjoys himself in an unostentatious
but suitably expensive way, and his various
responsibilities allow him to lead a life consisting
of occasional rushes of activity and prolonged
intervals of leisure. He most probably finds he
can spare a certain amount of money for speculation,
with a view to adding more to the sum
total of his income. He looks forward to handing
down to his children sufficient means to
make each of them independent, and meanwhile
has his boys educated in the large public schools,
where they can associate with boys who are
similarly situated.</p>

<p>What possible harm can there be in all this?
So far from being parasitic, he counts himself as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
a beneficent agent in the general industrial activity,
at the same time appearing as a credit to
his society and a notably refined product of the
class of which he is a member. Above all, he is
popular, and gains ostensibly the respect and
regard of his friends, his neighbours, and his
dependents. A favourable case has purposely
been made for him, because if we accuse him of
self-indulgence and greed, and describe him as a
gambler, spending his substance on objects which
are generally admitted to be pernicious and unworthy,
the case could not be defended at all.</p>

<p>The fundamental theory which makes this
man’s position untenable has already been explained—namely,
that after he has satisfied his
legitimate requirements all the surplus money
he keeps is being held back from serving urgent
needs; and, moreover, the method in which he
spends the surplus is directly or indirectly harmful
to himself and others.</p>

<p>We call the money his as if by some miracle
he had made it. Often enough he has not helped
even by the smallest exertion to create it. The
wealth has been and is being daily and hourly
produced by the exertion of numberless people
who are either employed by him or employed in
furthering enterprises in which he has invested
his money. It will be said that his share as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
wise dispenser of capital, without which labour
and enterprise could not be set in motion, is an
all-important part of the general process of
business. But he invests not to promote enterprise,
but to get high dividends; and an elaborate
system has been set up in order to tempt him to
put his money into concerns that are by no
means always sound or of the smallest public
utility. Capital would exist and flow far more
freely without the large capitalist. He acts as a
dam to the stream; a certain amount escapes
back into the main channel, but much more is
checked and diverted into stagnant and putrefying
pools of his own creation. The free flow of
blood is life-giving; the clotting or coagulation
of blood produces disease.</p>

<p>Let us take the various points raised by his
case <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">seriatim</i>. Many acutely controversial problems
are opened, and it will be difficult to
detach the particular actions of the rich man
without generalising, to some extent, on the
problems themselves. It is no argument against
our main contention to say that people with
costly tastes have, while gratifying them, been
able to exercise powers of a high order, for,
obviously, it is in spite of their shortcomings in
this respect that they have succeeded, and not
because of them. If some men with means have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
done valuable public service and performed admirable
work in many different spheres of life,
this they have done as men naturally gifted with
high accomplishments, not as rich men. Here
we are only concerned with their works and
deeds in their latter capacity.</p>

<p>It does not affect our argument whether our
typical example has been brought up to regard
this way of living as natural and necessary for a
man of what is called his “position” (that is to
say, the purely artificial place which a rich man
is able to take up in the community solely on
account of his riches), or whether he has made
the money for himself and is simply aping the
habits and customs of those who already possess
it. The distinction between the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vieux riches</i> and
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nouveaux riches</i> is one they can fight out
between themselves. The former scoffs at the
latter while all the time he is setting him, and
consciously setting him, the example he is to
follow. It is not the gaining, but the spending
of the money that must occupy our attention
here.</p>

<p>Our friend’s houses are only a detail in the
upkeep of his position. They may be historic
castles, sham “ancestral halls,” modern “palatial
country residences,” or “fashionable mansions”
in town. Does it ever strike the owner as, let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
say, a curious arrangement that he should have
several houses of fifty to a hundred rooms apiece
while some millions of his fellow-men do not own
one room? Does he know that in England and
Wales alone 507,763 people occupy one-room
tenements, 48.4% of which are classified as overcrowded,
while 12,458,150 are occupying tenements
of two, three, or four rooms?<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> In any
case, he would indignantly refuse to admit that
there was any remote connection between these
two sets of circumstances.</p>

<p>When we come to the staff necessary for the
maintenance of these large establishments we
touch a problem of employment which must be
examined more closely. It is not sufficient to
state baldly that these people are employed, and
that if the opening were not available for them
they would be unemployed. The immediate
result of their being discharged would no doubt
in some cases be unemployment. That is just
the mischief of uneconomic employment. If a
large number were simultaneously dismissed
there might be temporary unemployment on a
large scale, as it would amount to dislocation,
like the extinction of some dying industry. But
the eventual readjustment would subsequently
be by that much the stronger and better adapted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
to the real requirements of the community. To
employ a man in useless and unremunerative
work can be regarded in some aspects as worse
than not employing him at all. It is not intended,
however—and, indeed, it would be
impossible—here to enter into a discussion on
the whole problem of unemployment, but there
is undoubtedly a very great economic waste that
largely contributes to the gravity of the problem,
arising from the fact that a large number of
people are being forced to devote their labour
and energy to work which is, so to speak, final
and sterile. It is precisely the same with regard
to the production of expensive luxuries. The
employment of a large retinue is only another
form of the possession and enjoyment of articles
of excessive luxury. The employers and possessors
have all disagreeable burdens and every
sordid worry lifted from them, their smallest
and their most extreme desires for pleasure met,
their special appetites satisfied, their peculiar
vanities titillated, and their artificial position
safeguarded and maintained, without their giving
more than a passing thought to the mass of people
required to carry on this work. Plenty of examples
might be quoted in contemporary as well
as past history to show that after generations of
the enjoyment of “the vile joys of tainting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
luxury” men deteriorate, both physically and
mentally.</p>

<p>As for the particular line of life which domestic
service offers under modern circumstances, it is
not too much to say that it is, as a rule, very
demoralising, more especially for the men. And
its demoralising tendency increases in proportion
to the size of the establishment. The single
general servant lives a life of hard work but
genuine service on four to eight shillings a week,
often living in friendly relations with master or
mistress, and really lifting from them the burden
of necessary domestic duties which they with
limited incomes and professional work of their
own cannot possibly find time to perform; and
this remains true in other small households. In
the large house the faithful old family servant,
who is more of a friend than a servitor, is rare
in these days of ostentation. The butler, on
wages of fifty to sixty shillings a week, which
together with board and lodging represents from
£250 to £300 a year, has a life of leisure, ease,
and excessive comfort, seldom having to exert
himself even up to his limited capacities. Male
house-servants are often chosen for their looks;
their work is very light physically, they are overfed,
and being under-educated, can hardly be
blamed for becoming demoralised. These able-bodied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
men, whose muscles, if not their minds,
might be devoted to some really serviceable purpose,
are still increasing in numbers. Over
25,000 more male servants have got employment
in the last ten years, the total number now being
227,995. Even deducting the single indoor servant,
the single coachman or gardener, this means
a large increase of ornamental male attendants.
Female servants are becoming more difficult to
secure in the higher grades, because the class of
women from which they are drawn value their
liberty and are not so ready to sacrifice it for
food and comforts. In fact, they are showing
signs of impatience of control, and of preferring
the risky though exhilarating struggle of independence.
But still large retinues of men and
women exist solely employed in keeping up huge
houses to satisfy the vanity and minister to the
comfort of a comparatively few rich people. No
work of a more hopelessly barren, profitless, and,
indeed, degrading character could be found for
them. A system of tips deprives their smallest
acts of what might be an obliging and disinterested
intention. Arrangements are organised
with tradesmen to defraud the employers in
what is thought a perfectly legitimate way; the
actual waste of food is appalling, and by extras,
gratuities, perquisites, commissions, and pickings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
a considerable amount is added to the wages of
the upper servants. In these large establishments
immorality exists more as a rule than as an exception,
but it can be kept secret, for these
communities of private servants—like everything
else connected with the lives of the rich—cannot
be made the subject of investigation.</p>

<p>If assistance to those who need it is the object
of domestic service, it is striking to note that on
the money basis, generally speaking, the wrong
people are served. Who in the community most
require and should specially have the help of
servants? The old and infirm, the weak and ill,
the very young and the hard-worked. Service
under such conditions raises itself to the level
of one of the highest occupations that can be
imagined. But this is not our system. A man or
woman may be ill, old or over-worked, without
being able to get the assistance of a single soul.
Another man or woman may be young and
healthy and have at his or her command a
retinue of thirty servants or more, solely because
they have money and servants are forced, by
economic pressure, to devote their lives to the
menial task of furbishing up the endless and
complicated appanage of wealth.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to the inanimate luxuries,
taking into account only indisputable luxuries—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
is to say, articles of high price which have
no special artistic value, to which much labour
has been devoted and which are not produced to
serve any legitimately useful purpose. Luxury
has been well defined as “that which creates
imaginary needs, exaggerates real wants, diverts
them from their true end, establishes a habit of
prodigality in Society, and offers through the
senses a satisfaction of self-love which puffs up
but does not nourish the heart and which presents
to others the picture of happiness they can
never attain.”</p>

<p>Bond Street catalogues abound with any quantity
of examples. Furs at one thousand guineas,
fifty-guinea dressing-bags, twenty-guinea hats,
thousand-guinea tiaras, fruit and vegetables out
of season, cigars at three shillings apiece, ruinously
expensive wines, and fantastic foods of all
descriptions. There is no need to exaggerate,
for all those articles can be bought for much
higher prices than those quoted. A great amount
of skilled labour of a high order goes to the production
of these luxuries, and a great amount of
labour of the lowest and most cruelly sweated
description is also enlisted for their production,
and incredible as it may seem, it is on the ground
that they give employment that these luxuries
are defended. It was calculated in 1884<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
even giving a liberal extension of meaning to the
term “necessaries” and “comforts” of life,
over six millions of manual labourers, who with
their families constitute thirteen millions of the
population, were engaged in producing what, in
contradistinction to the above, must be classified
as luxuries.</p>

<p>A prominent statesman,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> expressing the views
of his class, said a few years ago: “The more
human wants are stimulated and multiplied, the
more widespread will be the inducement to hire.
Therefore all outcries and prejudices against the
progress of wealth and what is called luxury are
nothing but outcries of prejudice against the
very sources and fountains of all employment.”</p>

<p>On such an argument as this the defence of
luxuries generally rests. The essence of the
fallacy lies in the fact, which cannot be repeated
too often, that labour spent on such articles is
unremunerative and unproductive, because its
ultimate result is only to gratify various forms
of vanity and greed. To exemplify by a concrete
instance what is unremunerative and what
is remunerative, let us take a hundred-guinea
ball-gown and a pair of boots. It is not possible
to estimate the number of people employed in
producing the ball-gown. There is the silk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
satin, or whatever the principal material may
be; there are the trimmings of chiffon, hand-embroidery,
lace, braid, beads, sequins, ribbons,
etc., etc.; some hundreds of pairs of hands,
including factory-workers, dressmakers, sempstresses,
etc., will have touched some part of the
gown before it is delivered to the wearer. To
what end are all these specialised departments of
labour concentrated? The gown is worn a few
times in the one season; the wearer has the
satisfaction of feeling as well dressed as A. to F.,
and far better dressed than F. to Z. In fact,
the net result of all this expenditure of energy
is the generating of a rather foolish pride, the
encouragement of conceit on the one side and
envy on the other, and the hardening of a nature
into ways of worldliness and vanity.</p>

<p>As for the boots. Again, many more hands
than can be calculated have helped to produce
them, but they are directly and immediately
serviceable to the purchaser, to whose activity
the wearing of boots is an essential, and in general
they minister to the efficiency of human machines.</p>

<p>But if balls are not wrong, ball-gowns must be
worn. It is a question of degree; and here
again we get to the theory of the limit which in
this conjunction can be expressed thus: In relation
to human needs, in relation to human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
powers of enjoyment, in relation to the beneficial
effects of pleasure, even in relation to the dictates
of fashion, there is a distinct limit not to
be expressed in figures up to which expenditure
(in this particular case on dress) is legitimate and
relatively productive, beyond which it becomes
progressively unremunerative and harmful. A
hundred guineas, by any conceivable method of
calculation, greatly exceeds this limit.</p>

<p>To assert that the purchase of luxuries is good
for trade is quite as ridiculous as to say that a
man can benefit the building and furnishing
trade by burning down his house once a year.
We do not want to create more artificial wants
before we have satisfied the crying human needs
which already exist. There is no loophole
through which a reasonable defence of the senseless
expenditure, which goes on in an increasing
measure, can be made. Luxurious living has
never been quite so blatant and unashamed as it
is to-day, and the effete epicureanism and decadent
effeminacy it produces stand out in
rather sharp contrast to more hopeful signs of
progress and moral and intellectual refinement
and vigour which, happily, are visible around us.</p>

<p>A lady writing in a review in the early ’seventies
describes life in the country house, with its
futile routine of heavy meals, sport, card-playing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and vacuous inanities which take the place of
conversation, all very much as it is to-day. The
writer speaks with dismay of gowns costing sixty
guineas and of £1000 a year spent on clothes.
But these figures are almost negligible compared
with the sums spent nowadays. It is only
through occasional actions in the courts that
the outside public get an idea of what is actually
spent, and it is surprising that there are not more
disclosures, considering the mountainous debts
that are piled up in West End shops. But the
shopkeepers are very reluctant to lose a really
leading customer, and they know how to meet
the inconvenience of not being promptly paid.
A typical case may be given of an article of
clothing, the cost price of which was nine
guineas, being sold for £28 7s. There may be
delay in payment, but there appears to be compensation
in the profit.</p>

<p>When one hears of the woman who spent last
year £36 5s. on a hat, or another who gave £1250
for a sable cape, it is not the isolated action of
criminal folly that chiefly strikes one, but it is
that the hat and the cape act as indicators of the
sort of price such women are in the habit of
paying for their clothes, a large supply of
which are in the market ready to meet this
artificial demand. Moreover, the habit of extravagance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
especially as regards female clothing,
is catching and runs through all classes once the
example is set. It is a common enough and very
depressing sight to see absurdly elaborate clothes,
which are cheaper imitations of the latest fashions,
worn by women of the lower middle-class,
whose deplorable want of education is shown by
their inability even to pronounce their mother
tongue. They watch the rich, and gather from
what they see that fine feathers make fine birds,
and it is not on them that the blame should
rest.</p>

<p>Vanity exists and insists on being satisfied. It
is no good blinking the fact. Luxuries, in one
form or another, will continue to be produced.
But there is no reason why we should not stem
the current lest it swell to danger point. There
are many well-known historical examples of the
enervating and degenerating effect of luxury on
national life, and the modern tendency towards
an increased production of these indulgences
should be combated not only as a moral weakness,
but as an integral factor in the general
economic problem. When one considers what
real comfort of living, with all the necessary intellectual
and artistic equipage, opportunities for
amusement, and domestic convenience, can be
secured to-day at a comparatively moderate sum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
it makes the wild and profligate extravagance the
more inexcusable and the more futile.</p>

<p>Anyhow, let us abandon once and for all the
foolish and ignorant attitude of regarding this
display as a desirable form of industrial stimulus
which should be fostered and encouraged. Preaching
and writing against it has never been of the
smallest avail, but it has been necessary to deal
with it here as a very important, if not predominating,
element in the analysis of the rich
man’s conceptions of his duties.</p>

<p>In addition to luxuries of establishment,
clothes, and food there is a complicated ritual
of sport which in this country reaches an almost
incredible pitch. It has been estimated that
forty-five millions are permanently invested in
the apparatus of sport, and an income of over
forty millions spent annually upon it. We need
not discuss all the intricacies of the numerous
branches of sport, observing where its effect is
healthy and where harmful. No one will contend
that the most expensive forms of it are by
any manner of means the best. But the most
obvious harm to be noted in this connection is
the amount of land which is taken away from
agriculture for sporting purposes. Landlords often
keep up their shooting at a great loss, amounting
to something like five to ten pounds per bird<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
shot, all for the sake of having the shooting and
asking friends down for a few days in the year
to enjoy it. It is gravely regarded as an essential
part of the education of a young man in this
particular world to learn how to shoot. No
question, even with respect to his education or
possible professional career, is treated with more
seriousness than the moment he first handles a
gun, and family advice is sought as to how and
when encouragement can be given to the development
of this essential qualification which,
coupled with a knowledge of bridge, will make
him a desirable visitor in any country house.</p>

<p>At card-playing, which occupies a vast amount
of time in the lives of the rich, sums amounting
to hundreds are often lost or gained by one
person in one evening. But of the various sinks
which help to drain away their money, horse-racing
almost holds the first place. There are no
statistics to show how many people have been
ruined by it, or how many have been lured into a
life of gambling by their success in the betting
ring. But its popularity is certainly on the increase,
as we can see by looking at the number
of horses that have run under the rules of racing
in the last thirty years. In 1878 there were 2097;
in 1908 this figure had risen to 3706. The number
of larger race meetings advertised in advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
have more than doubled since 1881 (78 in 1881,
164 in 1909). Some sort of estimate of the
money spent on it, apart from betting, can be
gathered from the amounts won. In 1908 the
winning owners secured between them nearly a
quarter of a million pounds, the sums won by
the first thirty-six amounting to £246,001 15s.,
the largest total secured by one owner being
£26,246.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>The populace are invited to join in this pursuit,
though, of course, they must be railed off
to prevent too close contact with those who
come in coaches and motor-cars. The crowd is
vaguely supposed to be having a good time, and
any attack on horse-racing is met by hackneyed
arguments about “keeping up the national
sport” or “improving the breed of horses,” and
perhaps, again, the objection of unemployment
for jockeys and bookies might be dragged in.</p>

<p>It does not appear, however, to be a good
method of improving the human breed. In
observing the crowd on a race-course, whether it
be the well-dressed portion or the ill-dressed,
the betters or the bookies, neither a deep knowledge
of humanity nor a very close power of
observation into physiognomy is required to note
the prevalence of a remarkably low type. But a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
still more vivid impression of what the pleasures
of racing mean can be gained by going out on
the road in the evening towards the scene of a
large race meeting when the people are returning.
Brakes and carts in endless procession will
pass you loaded with men shouting in the excitement
of semi-drunkenness, or with heaps of
humanity sodden and silent in complete intoxication.
Outside every public-house on the roadside
traps await those who are squandering their
gains on further refreshment or soothing the
despair of losses in the temporary oblivion of
drink. The localities where there is an annual
race week suffer considerably, the inhabitants
become infected by the gambling and betting
mania, and during the actual days of the races
the place is infested by the lowest dregs of the
riff-raff who journey about from one race
meeting to another. This so-called sport produces
the lowest possible type; it degrades many
who take part in it with sinister rapidity, it encourages
fraud and deception, it is a canker of
rottenness in public life, and it receives the
highest sanction and patronage.</p>

<p>Many people are present at a race meeting
without being conscious that it is attended by
any evil consequences. They go to meet their
friends, perhaps putting an occasional sovereign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
on a horse to give them some interest in the
racing. To them the crowd is a natural part of
the proceedings, the heavy bets of the ring an
amusement. To have been there is something to
boast of, and conveys the idea that they have associated
with smart people. Thoughtless, as in so
many of their other pursuits, they accept the
whole proceeding as a recognised sport and they
inquire no further. The philosophy of these
people is the prevailing philosophy: “Do not
examine below the surface, or you are bound to
find something disagreeable. Take things as they
come; skim the cream off the top; avoid that
which is unpleasant or difficult to explain; and
above all things, do what others do.”</p>

<p>Yachting, which also runs away with a great
deal of money, comes under a very different category.
It is a health-giving and often strenuous
occupation, and the seamen employed are, anyhow,
deriving incidentally some positive benefit
from the life they lead. Nevertheless, out of the
4655 private yachts registered in the current
year (an increase of over 3500 in the last forty
years),<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> only a very small proportion are actually
navigated by owners who have any knowledge or
love of seamanship. The great majority are floating
houses of luxury (viz. a 700-ton steam yacht,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
for which £25 a day is paid for coal when in use),
or racing yachts, mere toys used to minister to
the fanciful pleasures of the rich.</p>

<p>But in expressing the strongest disapproval of
these excessive luxuries, it is not for a moment
suggested that people should rush into the opposite
extreme—live in discomfort and adopt the
craze for “the simple life,” which is only an inverted
form of vanity and ostentation. There
are many of the lesser luxuries which give great
pleasure and sufficient honest gratification to
justify their existence. There may even be some
reluctance in condemning extravagance, because
the nature of the extravagant man is far preferable
to the economical and cautious disposition
which sometimes sinks into niggardly meanness.
Moreover, any attempt at excessive restrictions
and unnecessarily harsh discipline in the upbringing
of children invariably leads to a violent
reaction in the direction of profligacy and extravagance.</p>

<p>Let human nature be allowed free play in all
directions; but it is not taking up the attitude
of an ascetic or of a prig to condemn unhesitatingly
unnatural excesses, reckless licence, the
extremes of self-indulgence and greed, the exercise
of which by some few involves the neglect,
misery, and ruin of so many others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Thieves when they steal use violence and are
pronounced enemies of society. These few
people, by a silent conspiracy in which we all
seem to acquiesce, are also stealing and are
equally enemies of society.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">The rich man’s charities—His generosity—His hospitality—His
land—The Feudal System—His responsibilities—The
agricultural problem.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> must now turn from what the rich man
spends on himself and consider what good
and what harm he does by his subscriptions and
donations to philanthropic and charitable objects.</p>

<p>In so far as he himself is concerned these gifts
do not involve any element of personal sacrifice;
the moral benefit which is by way of falling on
a giver is therefore nil. The exertion of writing
a cheque or banker’s order and the satisfaction
of imposing a tax on himself complete the
transaction on his side. Occasionally the sight of
his name published at the head of a list with a
large figure next it gives him a further agreeable
sensation, and he can become famous as a
household word of generous philanthropy without
the very smallest personal inconvenience. But
as an instance of pure charity—that is, loving
sacrifice—the poor woman who gives a penny
from her meagre store is on an entirely different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
plane. The picture presents itself to the present
writer of a woman at the doorway of a wretched
tenement, with her child in her arms, giving to a
passing vagrant who was suffering from hunger
and fatigue a penny from the few coins she had
in her purse. The expression of her face as she
handed him the money was the most sublime
illumination of pure charity—no subscription
list in the newspapers, no public recognition,
and the sacrifice, not of luxuries, but of something
that she and her baby needed. That something
went with her penny, and in return she received
something else for which there is no price,
no name, and no description. From such an
experience as this the rich are for ever cut off.
“Probably the most generous people in the
world,” says J. D. Rockefeller, perhaps realising
that charity is something he can never reach,
“are the very poor, who assume each other’s
burdens in the crises which come so often to the
hard pressed.”</p>

<p>The rich man’s so-called charity therefore
must be to a large extent mechanical and conventional.
He gives because others with the
same means give, and the charity touts know
how a list headed by Lord A. with a substantial
sum will produce equally or perhaps even more
substantial sums from Lord B., Sir. C. D.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Alderman E., and Mr. F. The extraction of
money from the rich is a business in itself,
requiring considerable skill, and the rich are
fleeced far more than they realise. In practical
America they take the trouble to teach
people professionally how to write what they
call “letters of appeal.” When we hear of
subscriptions to charities being stopped it may
serve to remind us that it is most inexpedient that
institutions such as hospitals should be at the
mercy of the casual caprice of rich men. Nothing
could eventually be more desirable than that
every one of them should cut off their charitable
contributions. It might entail a severe temporary
shock to the funds of charitable institutions,
as over seven millions a year is being spent
in London alone on charities, but at the same
time many ill-managed and misdirected endeavours
would disappear, and the State would come
to realise all the sooner its responsibilities in
respect to the maintenance of really necessary
institutions for the relief of suffering and the
nursing of the sick, in the same way as it is
beginning to recognise its duties towards poverty,
old age, and unemployment. There are other
enterprises which the State should undertake
that are often delayed in their institution owing
to the plea that the private munificence of rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
men can be depended upon. It is certainly
better that the funds should be expended thus
than in sheer self-indulgence, but it is evident
that the money would be far better spent and
the object on which it is spent better served if
the source were not controlled by the whims and
fancies of a single individual.</p>

<p>In regard to the more private and personal
aspects of the generosity attributed to riches:
“Surely,” a critic will say, “if the rich man is
benevolent and kindly disposed he can in a hundred
thoughtful ways help his poorer friends
by presents, by attention and timely help, by
opening the doors of his houses, lending his
conveyances, and showing many other attentions
which his money allows him to do, thereby
becoming justly popular and a source of great
good.”</p>

<p>The admiration, and just admiration, for open-handed
generosity and the justifiable dislike of
anything approaching miserliness in others cause
an entirely erroneous impression that large gifts
of money must unquestionably be praiseworthy
and commendable. But this is not the question
at issue. These are two moral qualities, the one
admirable, the other objectionable. The generous
disposition can show itself in many other
ways besides money gifts, and the real man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
behind the rich man, though he may be one and
the same individual, often comes forward with
simple acts of thoughtful kindness because the
finer qualities of human nature cannot be
stifled even by money. But in so far as the rich
man indulges his generosity in thoughtlessly
giving away money broadcast, it amounts to a
form of self-indulgence, and he is distinctly to
blame for not estimating more precisely the
effect of his actions. No doubt the harm of unwise
and foolish actions is palliated by the purity
and excellence of the motive. In so far as these
people intend to show kindness they are amply
justified in what they do. But let us consider
for a moment what the effect of their benevolence
is. In the first place they are made to occupy
an entirely false position as dispensers of charity.
Often, too, the desire to patronise and gain the
power that patronage gives blights the spirit of
genuine and unadulterated kindness, and further,
the recipients are placed in the extremely uncomfortable
and embarrassing situation of receiving
benefits, presents, and comforts which they
know they are not and probably never will be in
a position to return. To force anyone to be
under a lasting obligation is not the most likely
way of generating pure gratitude. There are
many who refuse outright rather than place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
themselves in this position: there are some
who take full advantage of the generosity
and, what is commonly called, “sponge” on
their benefactors, and if the possessors of abundance
refuse either from principle or out of indifference
to give freely they are severely blamed
and generally regarded as ungenerous and stingy.
The virtues were once called to a banquet by
“the Lord of All.” They talked and laughed
and each one knew the other well, but:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Benevolence and Gratitude<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alone of all seemed strangers yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stared when they were introduced,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On earth they never once had met.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In fact, the whole atmosphere created, not by
an isolated gift which has cost the donor more
than actual cash, but by the habit of doles,
bounty, and patronage is unhealthy and disturbing
and ultimately undermines the foundations
of natural human relations and mutual friendship.</p>

<p>An excuse will be sought for in the plea that
the exercise of hospitality is a duty performed
by the rich with some success. If the hospitality
of the rich is ever truly successful it is here again
the man, and not his money, that brings this
about. Crowds of guests at country houses or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
dinner parties who regard their host and hostess
as nothing more than innkeepers or restaurant
proprietors are common enough, and it is a well-known
expedient for those who are busy “climbing”
(and their name is Legion) to use hospitality
as a means of getting hold of the “right people.”
But the small gathering met together in a common
interest and mutual regard to enjoy the warming
intercourse of friendship does not require the
accompaniment of a ten-course dinner nor the
surroundings of a vast establishment, and is,
happily, as easily within the reach of the poorer
sections of the community as of the rich. Money,
therefore, does not facilitate or elevate hospitality.
It manifestly tends to lower its quality and
depreciate its value.</p>

<p>It may be argued further in connection with
large establishments and hospitality that certain
noble traditions founded on an excusable pride
of family or race are to be found attached to
the great historic establishments of the nobility.
There is no great harm in this sentiment and
from the archæological point of view it has a
certain attractive interest. But it is too much
for the high nobility to expect that they can
continue to carry on these traditions throughout
all time, preserving the habits and customs of
past ages in a world that has changed and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
continue to change. No one will quarrel with
them if they ask that their lineage and family
history should be respected, but money will not
help them now, and when they consider themselves
entitled to administer autocratically their
millions in order to preserve their princely
dignities, they are asking for privileges which the
modern economic State and the growth of
democracy are every year showing more and
more to be inconsistent with good government
and the healthy life of the people. And often
by their riches they only succeed in reproducing
a somewhat vulgar travesty of the splendour
and distinction of their ancestors in bygone ages.</p>

<p>The typical instance we are examining has
been described as a landlord who owns villages
and keeps his cottages carefully repaired (this,
we may note in passing, is not by any means the
invariable practice). He dispenses charity to
the villagers with open-handed generosity, providing
thoughtfully the sack of coals in winter,
the occasional pound of tea, the knitted waistcoats
for the little boys, the scarves and hoods
for the little girls, and what could be more
idyllic than to see the children bobbing curtsies
and touching their caps to the people from the
great house?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this sham feudalism is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
generally upheld more by a love of power and
patronage than by kindness of heart. Our
landlord is consciously proud of having people
directly dependent on him whom he can order
according to his will (even at election time),
whom he can enrich or impoverish as he judges
right, and can remove from his cottages when
they do not please him. If the result is spick
and span to the eye and he is greeted by smiles
of apparent gratitude he feels, and it is difficult
to disillusion him, that his methods are successful,
and he is induced to believe that his actions are
justified and his presence in the community indispensable.
But what kind of impression is in
reality produced on those who come under his
sway? Not gratitude, because they soon begin
to regard his gifts as a natural right, and knowing
that the squire can easily afford so much, discontent
is likely to be roused that he does not
give more. Consequently a whole class of people
are retained devoid of all the self-reliance and
energy which independence alone can give.
Without their being aware of it, the yoke of
subjection is placed upon them under the guise
of beneficent charity, weighing them down,
creating in them false habits of cringing subservience,
and indefinitely postponing the day of
their liberation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
The landlord is not the elected chief of a
village community whom the people can feel to be
one of themselves, chosen by them and removable
by them. Under such circumstances service
is no longer subservience, for congregations of
human beings will always seek out their leaders,
organisers, managers, or controllers. But this
landlord has imposed himself upon them, or is
the descendant of one who imposed himself on
their fathers, who took, in fact, what was once
rightfully theirs, enclosed it or confiscated it.
To go no further back than the Enclosure Acts,
one can note the irreparable wrongs that were
then committed by those who had the political
power in their hands. Arthur Young reported
in 1801 that “by nineteen Enclosure Acts out of
twenty the poor are injured, and in some cases
greatly injured.” The protests made at the
time were practically unheeded by an aristocracy
too much absorbed in making its fortune to give
a thought to the ruin of the classes that were
losing their little inheritance in the common
fields or the common waste. We repeat, the
landlord has imposed himself upon them; this
he can do, and will continue to do, not because
he is particularly fitted by special training for
the administration of landed property, nor even
because he has a strong preference for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
pursuit of agriculture, but simply and solely because
he has money. To state his one qualification
for the position he holds is quite sufficient
to prove its falseness and absurdity.</p>

<p>In the argument we are following the underlying
principle, which might be called the doctrine
of human incapacity, or more correctly, perhaps,
of human limitations, becomes more evident
with regard to the rich man’s landed property
than his other possessions and investments,
especially if we are inclined to believe that the
earth’s surface and its minerals, by their very
nature, like light, air, and water, should be part
of the common inheritance of man.</p>

<p>Can an estate of many thousands of acres be
developed and cultivated to its fullest extent in
every corner under the guidance of one individual,
who, even though he may have exceptional
knowledge of farming and may use skilled agents,
is nevertheless concerned with many other
interests which he desires to serve? Are there
any of the large estates which can be pointed to
as models? Are there not rather many estates
that serve as striking instances of the failure of
the system? Are there not acres upon acres of
land which might be yielding great abundance,
real wealth for the nation, which are either
badly managed, neglected, left as waste, or kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
for sporting purposes? There is no need to
mention the building land which is often held
up by them until the efforts of the local community
have increased the value sufficiently to
yield them a substantial increment, because this
is a source of income and not an object on which
they spend money. On agriculture they do
spend money, and they ask, in consequence, that
the ownership of land should be recognised as
“an industry.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> They ask, “above all, the right
to select the persons to be associated with the
proprietor in his cultivation of the soil.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> The
good landlord who is something of an agriculturist
and devotes time and trouble to his
property is often in despair at his want of success,
which he attributes to the burdens on land, to
our fiscal system, or to the incompetence of the
agricultural labourer, and he is always declaring
his land to be a drain on his wealth rather than a
source of income, but never does it cross his
mind for an instant that possibly he himself is
undertaking a task which is far beyond his powers
and that his pretensions are quite unjustifiable.</p>

<p>The co-operation of farmers or small holders
working for the quality of what they produce
and not for filling their pockets and extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
their estates, secure in their independence,
acting separately so far as separate action is
conducive to good cultivation and co-operating
when united action can produce better results,
this method, as actually practised in Denmark,
for instance, must obviously be superior both for
the land and for the people. But the deplorable
lack of scientific knowledge, the unprogressive
methods of our farmers, the engrained readiness
to be controlled by some social superiors, makes
the rapid extension of such a system impossible.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we cannot accept our rich
man’s plea that as a landlord, even as a good
landlord, his expenditure is profitable. It is not
that he makes nothing but mistakes; it is that he
cannot give sufficient time and attention to it;
it is that he is by nature incapable—an incapacity
which he shares with every other mortal—of
deriving from his estate of some thousands of
acres all that it could produce. It follows that
his action in keeping to himself large tracts of
this unique form of property is depriving many
of a means of employment and countless hundreds
of the enjoyment of the fruits of the land;
it is driving the population from the country
districts to overcrowd the towns, add to the
number of the unemployed, and swell the volume
of crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
The land question with all its ramifications is
perhaps the most complex and vast of the many
subjects that are touched by the responsibility of
riches, but it is one that more completely than
any other illustrates the argument, and is the best
evidence of the limitation of the rich man’s
powers. In no field of human activity ought it
to be tolerated that an entirely unfitted and untrained
man should be put at the head of so difficult
and highly technical a business as the management
of land. When this occurs in commerce the business
collapses, but in land management the owner
remains doing untold damage and often playing
the ridiculous part of a territorial magnate or a
petty monarch, to his own hurt and to the hindrance
of his subjects. An American writer
making a survey of life in England to-day says,
“When one hears, and one does hear it on every
hand, how poor are Englishmen, one has in this
land question some explanation of the secret.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> natural desire of every man is to do the
best he can for his children, and in this
respect the rich man feels that his money is of
special advantage to him. But are healthy upbringing
and good education superior in quality
if they are expensive? The whole trouble with
regard to these children is comprised in the fact
that they know they are going to have money,
so that from the earliest age they accept their
elevation from the common herd as a matter of
course, and assume the easy assurance and authoritative
manner which always characterises
them. Their childhood they spend guarded by
servants, nurses, governesses, and tutors, often
without coming much into personal contact with
their parents or deriving any benefits from
parental care and affection, the strongest of all
the variety of influences in a man’s life; they
also have a more or less general consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
that anything they want can be had for the
asking. The boys are sent to public schools,
where there are many others in a like position,
and where the expense of education is greater
than in other schools, and its quality rather
inferior. Here they are given a vague notion of
ancient Jews, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,
and of England in the Middle Ages. But nothing
is taught them of contemporary history, of
English literature, or of how their own country
is governed to-day, nor is a moment found during
those early years for a preliminary study of
political economy or some elementary exposition
of industrial and social problems, though such
exposition would be invaluable, if only to impress
on young and acquisitive minds the fact
that such problems exist. In short, the world
they are living in is never explained to them.
And, whatever they may learn, from start to
finish they are assiduously kept in a groove
where their own class is represented to them as
the predominating and important section of the
community, which may expect service but need
not render it.</p>

<p>To do schoolboys justice, however, they cannot
be accused of being snobs. They care
nothing for rank or riches. They have their own
particular standard of judging who is “a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
chap” and who is not, and on the whole their
verdict is shrewd and not unfair. They are apt
to be over-severe against breaches of their particular
code, and they are very suspicious of any
signs of originality. It is in this direction that
they make many serious mistakes. But that a
boy has a title is a matter of complete indifference
to them, or whether or not he be the son
of very rich parents is a matter about which they
would not think it worth while to inquire. No
distinctions are made; the sons of the rich mix
with their school-fellows without being conscious
of occupying any special position, and
their school-fellows accept them without even
knowing they are the sons of the rich. The harm
they do quite unconsciously is not of an obvious
kind, and its very subtilty prevents it from being
recognised. They themselves know what the
future has in store for them, and it necessarily
affects their attitude towards school work and
general intellectual training for after life. They
are callous and indifferent as to education, regarding
it not as an essential preparation for
their life’s work, but as a tedious exercise which
has to be gone through, and in which they are
assisted by the natural curiosity of youth and an
instinctive dislike of ignorance. If they are
popular this view, accompanied by a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
amount of swagger and a preference for and often
a proficiency in games and sport, gives them a
position which is distinctly attractive to the boy
mind, and their influence spreads very rapidly
among those who in after life have got to work
for their livelihood. In those schools where there
is no disturbing element emanating from the
presence of rich leisured boys the standard of
efficient work—not estimated by the measure of
worldly success which titles and position afford—will
be found to be higher than in the few schools
which lay themselves out to receive this class of
boy. It is not to be inferred that the rich man’s
son never has sufficient ability and, indeed, industry
to distinguish himself in the intellectual
field. But it is the influence and example of those
who have been brought up from their earliest
childhood knowing that they have not to work
in order to live, that creates an atmosphere which
must be unfavourable to the training of boys for
whom life is not to be one prolonged holiday.</p>

<p>At the university the superiority of the position
of richer boys is first acknowledged. They
are free to spend their money and make the display,
in one direction or another, which is to
distinguish them from their fellows for the rest
of their lives, and recruits for their band of
toadies and tuft-hunters begin to enlist. Should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
they not be completely independent the question
of the choice of a profession has to be discussed,
and is almost invariably regarded purely from
the monetary point of view of pay and salary.
Many either enter professions which they allow
to occupy very little of their time or have no
profession at all, and their incomes preclude
them from deriving any of the unquestionable
advantages of professional training and discipline,
without which no man can be expected to cultivate
the talents he may possess, or acquire knowledge
and experience which might make him a
useful associate in the general activity of the
community he lives in. We will not enlarge on
the sort of life they lead—the unrelieved pursuit
of enjoyment, the London season, the country
house parties, the race meetings, the shooting
and hunting, the visit to the Continental watering-place
to recover from the fatigues before starting
again, and so on and so on. It is sufficient to
know that they contribute as little as possible to
and extract as much as they can from the general
fund of national wealth.</p>

<p>The girls meanwhile receive hardly any real
education at all, except in the knowledge of the
little world which they are taught to believe is
the whole world, and within the walls of which
they are probably destined to spend the remainder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
of their days. The moment of “coming
out” is held before them as the one thing to
look forward to. And when the longed-for day
arrives, it is only the signal for the commencement
of an exhausting round of pleasures sanctioned
by their society and represented to them
as being the one absorbing business of life. It is
only charitable to accuse them of being uneducated,
otherwise it would be hard to explain
psychologically the attitude of mind, of cheerful
acceptance of the fate in store for them instead
of rebellion against it. If, in rare cases, they
attempt to follow a line of their own and join
the professional class, every conceivable obstacle
is put in their way, and the prejudice against
work which is not the business of “a lady” is
generally strong enough to drive them back into
the smooth groove of leisure. Not infrequently
this fatal obligatory idleness crushes the spirit
out of them.</p>

<p>In later years love and marriage, difficult
enough problems for anyone, have additional
snares and pitfalls for the children of the rich.
It is true that the rich man can marry the penniless
girl to whom he is devoted, and the rich girl
can accept the man who is struggling for a
living. But the far more frequent occurrence is
for the rich girl to be captured by the man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
wants her money, and for the rich man to be
entrapped by the ambitious mother who wants
his wealth for her daughter. Not even experience
teaches. Instances could be given of women
who have married for money, and though every
page of their life has taught them the folly of
this irreparable step, yet they refuse to learn.</p>

<p>They spend their later life in arranging marriages
at all costs with rich men for their daughters,
placing insurmountable obstacles in their
way if they attempt marriages on moderate
means, which must entail their dropping out
from the ranks of the select. So it is that here
again money, far from assisting, impedes and
even stifles the natural preferences of human
affections, and the average of unfortunate and
disastrous unions is far higher among the rich
than in any other class. Some people are apt to
believe that the society scandals which afford so
much material for newspaper reports and gossip
give an unfair impression of the frequency of
these disasters, which they maintain arise just as
often in other classes of society, but are not as
widely reported. This is not the case. In the
middle and lower professional classes, where marriages
have been contracted by parties free to
exercise their natural choice and where lives are
filled with work and occupation, scandals of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
description are very rare. It is in the class where,
as we have shown, the power to select is restricted
and distorted, where life itself deteriorates into
prolonged idleness and self-indulgence and the
natural obligations of motherhood are disregarded
and shirked, and it is also at the very bottom of
the scale, where vice and degradation produced
by want engender brutality, where, in fact, there
is too much and where there is too little, in the
scum and in the sediment, that married life becomes
most frequently intolerable.</p>

<p>A critic may now begin to insist that it is all
very well to condemn the large servile establishments,
futile luxuries, defective education, and
foolish marriages as the outcome of riches, but
that, taking them as a whole, the class that have
the assured possession of wealth are superior in
the refinements of mind and body to the lower
classes, and that as you go higher in the scale of
society the proportion of mental and physical
excellence gradually increases.</p>

<p>The very use of the words high and low shows
how completely the money standard is accepted
sociologically. If you have money you are high-class,
if you have not money you are low-class.
Though poverty may militate against refinement,
have riches anything to do with it? The two
principal effects that riches exercise on character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
are either to weaken it into effeteness or debase
it into coarseness. Our aristocracy, for instance,
so long as they were occupied with fighting or
with the responsibilities of government—so long,
in fact, as they had some business of their own—preserved
a certain distinction, and by a careful
process of selection and intermarriage, avoided
any coarsening of their breed. This, for a time,
may have endowed them with a certain high
average of refinement of manner and tastes. But
when by the changes in our system of government,
and later by the rise of democracy, that is
the great mass of the people awakening to a consciousness
of their own existence, the aristocracy
became more and more cut off from national
services and had recourse to leisured lives of unemployment
and pleasure, the characteristics of
effeteness and what the French call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fin de race</i>
began to show themselves. In many cases downright
impoverishment overtook those who had
squandered their incomes on unprofitable amusement
and stupid dissipation, till at last they seem
to have come to a determination to rehabilitate
their position and reinforce their caste by means
of commercial and American money.</p>

<p>The plutocracy gained ground immensely by
the absorption in its ranks of ancient families
and long genealogies, and the aristocracy became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
increasingly tainted with commonness, losing its
distinction and substituting for it ostentation,
vulgarity, and the appreciation of money for its
own sake. They derived no advantage physiologically
in the shape of health and vigour which
any alliance with the poorer class might have
given them.</p>

<p>So far from anything in all this indicating that
money produces refinement, the exact opposite
is proved. That a full competence enables a
man to appreciate the refinements of life is,
after all, what we are doing our best to show;
but riches—that is to say, anything beyond the
competence—can only act as a fatal impediment
even to this.</p>

<p>Whatever refinement there may be in the
upper classes is only a survival, an element that
is not being preserved, but is rapidly waning.
Their general disposition and influence is a source
of anxiety to many who are watching the signs
of the times with attention. A recent article in
the <cite>National Review</cite> sounded a grave note of
warning. “Inherited vitality of race,” said the
writer, “which upper-class women still preserve
until they dissipate it in keeping up with the
procession, is frittered away by parental irresponsibility,
often commencing before birth, and by
the ever-increasing excitement, restlessness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
luxury of our generation.... Greed of money
is unblushing, and perhaps most shameless
amongst mothers and daughters.... Plutocracy
and vanity are in possession.” Out of
such poor stuff, he concludes, no man of character
or ability can come forward in public life.</p>

<p>Another significant result of the kind of life
of continual excitement, constant change, combined
with sensuous ease, led by these people, is
the noticeably declining birth-rate among those
who are well off.</p>

<p>It is not worth while here to enter into a
diatribe against the habits and customs, the
fashions and fancies, of what is known as Smart
Society, which is the general aggregate of people
of affluence; or attempt to describe the various
sets, the life struggle for those in one grade to
lift themselves into what they think a higher and
smarter grade; the necessary qualifications to
enter this society; the wild and ceaseless hunger
for excitement and amusement which prevents
any time being allowed for reflection, reading,
or even ordered thought; the cynical and inane
quality of the intercourse; the endless gossip;
the contempt for anything that is considered
dowdy; the accepted low level of morality and
network of irregular relationships; the snobbishness,
the artificiality, the want of education;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
in fact, all the low standard of living down to
which any set of human beings is bound to
fall if the key-note of their existence is idleness
and the foundation of their position is money.
They are frightened of thought because it might
plunge them into desperation, they are frightened
of knowledge because it might dispel their dearest
illusions, they are frightened of work because
it might reveal their incompetence, they are
frightened of progress because it may shatter
their citadel.</p>

<p>One would have imagined that the so-called
sporting instinct which we are so proud of nurturing
in our public schools and the spirit of
fair play would have made men ashamed to continue
to lead lives solely and systematically devoted
to extravagance and selfish enjoyment
while so many of their fellow-men are condemned
to the dismal existence of toil and squalor, even
if they refused to admit that the one influenced
the other. There are, of course, people in this
society who endeavour, more or less successfully,
to stand up against the drift of fashion and are
conscious of the falseness of their privileged
position, but they are exceptional. It appears to
be impossible for the very great majority to get
the delusion out of their heads that, by pensions
and doles, and charities and patronage, and presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
of game and subscriptions, and the employment
of people in senseless occupations, they are
doing all that can be expected of them to help
“the lower orders.”</p>

<p>If in all this luxury there were some trace of
splendour or magnificence, if art, literature, or
music were generously patronised, and beauty
and good taste appreciated, some slight justification
or excuse for it might be found. The rich
magnates of Renaissance Italy or eighteenth-century
France had, on the whole, a favourable
though capricious influence on art and literature.
But the rich magnates of twentieth-century England
are chiefly noted for the deplorable vulgarity
of their taste and their ignorance of the
best works in painting, literature, and music. At
the best, some few of them are collectors, and if
ever they seek the advice of experts to establish
some permanent method for the encouragement
of the arts, too often their motive is not any
profound reverence for artistic beauty, but the
spurious fame or titular distinctions they can
gain by this means. The private collections they
form are rarely exhibited, and being withheld
from the public view and from popular appreciation,
the true function of these great works of
art is almost nullified.</p>

<p>Taking it as a whole, the manner of living of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
this set of people would not be worth a moment’s
attention were it not that human beings are
being sacrificed and talents and capacity prostituted,
and that the example set by these few is
assiduously studied and followed by a large
section of the population who aspire to associate
with those of higher rank and greater wealth.
So it is that special notice is taken of all they do;
the limelight is turned full upon them, and
nothing can surpass the servility of that section
of the public press that recounts the doings of
these parasites, describing with intense solemnity
their entertainments and their hunting and
shooting exploits, and giving embarrassingly intimate
episodes from their private lives for public
consumption. By publishing broadcast these
alluring pictures it attempts to glorify their
profitless and empty existence.</p>

<p>From time to time, in sheer exasperation at the
senselessness of it all, men come forward and inveigh
against society life; but not only does this
not make the very smallest impression, but the
objects of their invective enjoy abuse and thrive
on the advertisement it gives them.</p>

<p>The life of this society represents the outward
and visible expression of all the various contributory
elements we have been trying to
analyse; it has, therefore, been necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
allude to it in order to give some general notion
of the way many of the rich live. And it is done
in no cavilling or pharisaical spirit, but with the
keen desire to expose a state of social corruption
which can only be corrected in the long run by
being brought fully into the light. The beauty,
the smartness, and the brilliancy on the surface,
like the flowers and lights and jewels of their
entertainments, produce an attractive glamour
and present an alluring picture for those who
cannot see further behind the scenes, and form
one of the chief inducements for money-making
and for continuing the fight for material gain.</p>

business—Money-making the incentive—Money no measure

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">So</span> far the type chosen has been that of an
aristocratic landed proprietor. But aristocrats
and landowners are not all rich men, nor
are all rich men aristocrats or landed proprietors.
A large proportion are business men who have
made or are making their fortunes through some
commercial undertaking or from successful speculations.
Once the business man has succeeded he
is pretty sure to buy an estate, but there are
many rich men who do not claim to be engaged
in the “industry” of land proprietorship. In
the argument we have to meet here it is claimed
for money that it is the mainspring of initiative
and enterprise in commerce, and is the just
reward of skilful management and business
ability.</p>

<p>But before proceeding let us remember once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
more the main premises of our contention. It
may be as undesirable as it is impracticable to
eliminate the undoubted incentive which the
desire for more money creates. But it can be
curbed before it reaches an exaggerated extreme,
and it can be rationalised once people understand
that great riches are no real reward, only mean
excessive burden, do not minister to human
happiness, and impose a responsibility which no
living being is capable of discharging.</p>

<p>In the commercial world it is evident enough
that the money-making ideal is far stronger and
predominates over the ideal of securing perfection
in production, which implies a proud ambition
to produce the best goods under the best
possible conditions. In the conflict between
these two ideals is precisely where the danger lies.
Tricks such as extensive and sensational advertisement
and unscrupulous pushing are, as we all know,
more favoured than the slower, more laborious,
and less certain expedients of continually improving
the methods of production and conditions
of labour. Many a fortune has been made
in the vast expansion of a concern far beyond its
intrinsic merits simply by means of advertisement.
The incentive in such a case is solely money-making.
The talents required are those of an
inferior order, such as astute business capacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and cunning. So far, therefore, as money-making
is the ideal, it is neither to the advantage of the
business nor to the advantage of the community,
who are the consumers of whatever commodity
the business turns out, any more than it is to the
ultimate advantage, as already shown, of the man
who enriches himself. The ambition of heads of
firms to enrich themselves personally constitutes,
in fact, the chief deterrent to permanently successful
commercial enterprise. A further step is
made in the wrong direction when the founder
of a thriving business, having made his fortune
and established the reputation of his firm, has his
son or successor educated at a public school and
university, where he may learn the manners and
customs of the leisured classes. The result is
that when the successor, who has not received a
special technical business training and is therefore
quite unfitted to keep abreast of the acute competition
which he finds in the commercial world
around him, takes over the business, it rapidly
deteriorates, in spite of the abortive efforts of the
new head, who probably thinks that by mere
expenditure of money the situation can be
saved. In instances such as these no defence can
be made for the accumulation of capital in the
hands of individuals. But let us take a better
type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
A man by his energy and industry creates a
successful business. As his fortune grows he
makes no difference in his private life beyond
that which his increasing obligations absolutely
necessitate. He judiciously sinks the greater part
of his profits in his business in order to improve
it continually in all its branches. He makes his
son or successor go through the mill, educating
him himself technically in every process connected
with the work so that in his turn he will be
thoroughly fitted to conduct the concern in the
same progressive spirit. This case, where a man
has resisted the temptation of taking full personal
advantage of his riches to, what is called, “lift”
himself into another sphere of society and consort
with a different and, of course, we must say
“higher” class, is not common. He has, so
to speak, identified himself with his work, absorbed
himself in its continuous efficiency, and, in
fact, very properly treats his wealth as a trust
created by those who are working for him and
also by those who are consuming his produce, and
he therefore returns it to them in the shape of
more favourable conditions for his workers and
improvements in machinery and methods of production,
which permit a better and cheaper article
to be delivered to the consumer. The danger in
this is not connected with the conduct of the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
himself, but it lies in the fact that this admirable
manner of conducting the business and dealing
with the profits depends solely on the one individual
will. There is no security or guarantee
that his successor will see fit to behave in the
same way. The money, being in individual hands,
will sooner or later fall into the less worthy
grasp of a man whose interest in the business is
insignificant compared with his desire to cut a
figure of importance by means of his riches. Our
ideal manufacturer is not treating the money or
spending it as if it were his own. But nevertheless
it is his own to dispose of, and he will leave
his large profits to a successor on whose whim
and fancy the responsibility of their administration
again rests.</p>

<p>There is no reason why he should not raise
himself into another plane and, after resigning
the management of his business to other hands,
extend his activities in another direction and
achieve further success. For the few, however,
who by force of character and exceptional ability
are able to rise to the level of their new circumstances,
there are many more who, simply taking
advantage of their riches, abandon one form of
activity, which was useful and in which they
excelled, for the sake of associating themselves
with a leisured, ease-loving, arid society to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
they do not naturally belong and which they had
been wiser to avoid. There are many men who
can stand up against adversity, but it requires a
character of great depth and force to keep its
balance against success.</p>

<p>Acknowledged worldly success for which full
credit is given publicly is not necessarily achieved
by the exercise of superior intellectual or business
ability, but can be obtained, just as titles and
honours, by the judicious expenditure of money.
It naturally appeals strongly to people who like
appreciation and applause, and after all, who
does not? But the worth of a man can no
more be estimated by his money value than the
worth of an article. The doctor who charges a
high fee is not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> a good doctor, but many
of them are astute enough to see that by raising
their fee they can enhance their reputation, so
easily gullible do they know their rich patients to
be. The same with lawyers, who trade on the
folly of those who can afford the luxury of litigation.
This expensive system reacts upon the
administration of justice, because it means that
in the majority of cases it is only the rich who
can secure the best legal skill for their defence in
the courts. Thus even our boasted equality before
the law is not immune from this universal
disease. In the scientific and creative world great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
achievements receive next to no recompense and
often only very tardy recognition. Great services
and great merit have no price: a gift of
money is no reward for the man who has experienced
the inestimable satisfaction of real achievement
unless it is to prevent his falling into
penury.</p>

<p>Public opinion is quite unable to judge true
merit, so high fees, huge salaries, grants, and
fabulous prices are reserved for those beings and
those things to which fashion and popular
clamour point at the moment. An Italian old
master which fifty years ago could be bought for
fifty pounds or so will now fetch as many hundreds
or even thousands. A mezzotint which a
few years back cost a trifling sum can now be sold
for fifty times the amount. So it is with all <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">objets
d’art</i>, plate, or furniture. The price does not
represent value nor demand, but the passing fancy
of rich collectors who set the fashion of the day
which they and the dealers create among themselves
without reference to artistic merit or good
taste, or even popular appreciation. By the
fabulous prices which nowadays are asked and
given some estimate can be made of the resources
of those who have got these vast sums to play
with. So that even in the purchase of works of
art, which need not be classed as luxuries, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
they can be in the highest sense remunerative,
an ever-increasing amount of money is absolutely
wasted in speculation and gambling.</p>

<p>To maintain the supremacy of money as a
standard, as a test, as a reward, and as an incentive,
we have a whole body of professions exclusively
devoted to the making of it for themselves
and for us without our having the exertion of
working for it. And yet they and their army of
clerks have to slave in their offices, lending,
borrowing, broking, speculating, gambling, company-promoting,
constructing syndicates, creating
trusts and combines, occupied with all the
complicated and involved tricks of a trade which
of all trades is the most tricky. They must not
be too nice or too scrupulous. They must
suppress any inclination they might naturally
have to be sensitive or particular. They are
occupied largely in trying secretly to get the
better of someone else or sometimes in manipulations
of a dubious, or perhaps we ought to say
mysterious nature, and their profession, which is
avowedly and exclusively to make money at all
costs, must of necessity cast some blight on their
lives and characters.</p>

<p>An increasingly large share of the wealth of
the modern world falls into the hands of stock-brokers,
company-promoters, and other financiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
who are the high priests of money. Such is their
power in controlling the money market, manipulating
prices, and directing gambling operations
on the stock exchange that they gradually come
to occupy the place of government not only in
the world of finance, but in the industrial world
and even to some extent in the world of politics.
The large body of ordinary investors and speculators
are completely at their mercy, for only a
very few can pretend to master or follow the
intricacies of this highly elaborated system which
the large financiers have set up like a huge web
to catch all contributions coming from the investments
and savings of the general public. But
the general business of private finance is the
immediate concern of every man, and it is certainly
the subject about which most people think
they know something and many people know a
good deal. Mystery pervades it. A man will tell
you his professional experiences, he will even
confide to you his domestic cares and his moral
delinquencies, his religious views he is ready to
lay bare before you. But on his financial affairs
he will be silent, and no one would dream of committing
the indiscretion of questioning him on
so delicate and sacred a topic. Little or nothing
is known of how a man comes by his money. The
industry or ability he has displayed in making his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
fortune is not what is admired, but his actual
riches. It never occurs to people to inquire if or
how a man has earned his money, all they want to
know is if he has actually got it.</p>

<p>Setting aside self-indulgence, the chief pleasure
of riches is said to be the enjoyment of the power
they give. This power, which we are trying to
prove is only a power for harm, is associated
with a sense of individual superiority. Whether
in charity, philanthropy, patronage, or investment
producing further gain, the predominant experience
for the individual is personal triumph.
It is not unjust to condemn the appreciation of
power such as this as a low form of pleasure not
only for its pure selfishness, but because triumph
in this connection implies control of other
individuals and power to gain advantage at their
cost. It is a form of self-glorification and exultation
which simply means that to have wealth is to
have the whip hand.</p>

<p>No one hopes for or expects complete repression
of self, but in any corporate action for a
common object, where there is a certain necessary
self-repression, the satisfaction to the individual
is unquestionably higher and purer. At any
rate, the idealisation of a personal pre-eminence
and ascendancy which is supported on the clay
feet of material possessions is idolatry of the
most dangerous type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
There is, moreover, attached to the possession
of wealth another sort of power which is even
more dangerous from the public and national
point of view, but which is valued and appreciated
even by those who recognise that sheer
hedonism defeats its own object. It is the pressure
which capital can bring to bear on the
machinery of government. Private commercial
interests can translate themselves into political
influence both in particular constituencies and
nationally through propaganda and the Press.
They can foster the Imperialist spirit, which may
mean the acquisition of more territory and the
opening out of fresh markets for the investment
of their capital. Meanwhile these enthusiastic
Imperialists can pose as patriots, although the
further filling of their pockets, and not the nation’s
honour, is their objective. “The economic root
of Imperialism,” says a modern economist,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> “is
the desire of strong organised industrial and
financial interests to secure and develop at the
public expense and by the public force private
markets for their surplus goods and their surplus
capital. War, militarism, and a spirited foreign
policy are the necessary means to this end.”</p>

<p>Imperialism, which depends on rousing the pugnacious
and combative instincts latent in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
people by exaggerating international differences
and jealousies, is the national expression, under
the guise of patriotism, of the desire for gain,
territorial aggrandisement, profit and enrichment.
It represents everything, in fact, that corresponds
to the love of money-making in the individual.
There is money even to be got out of arming
your enemies, and there is no squeamishness
shown about investing money in this way.</p>

<p>Although bribery can influence votes and a
few constituencies can still be bought, the necessity
of being a man of means in order to be admitted
into active political life is happily a thing
of the past. On the other hand, the influence of
the capitalist press, run as it is now, chiefly as a
financial speculation, has in later days grown to
be a grave national peril. The power here
exercised is of a very distinct and far-reaching
description. The ambitions of capitalism and
the demands of shareholders are interpreted as
the will of the people, and the worst instincts of
aggressive arrogance are traded upon to produce
at the proper moment the scare or outburst of
jingoism; at the same time, “popular” protests
can be artificially engineered to stand against any
movement which is likely to interfere with the
ambitions of the wealthy.</p>

<p>Money, therefore, does mean power, but power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of a pernicious description, “that of brute force,
the power of the bludgeon and the bayonet and
of the bribed press, tongue, and pen.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Having discussed worldliness, vanity, and self-indulgence
as well as commercial enterprise and
speculation, we must get to close quarters with
an aspect of the problem which at first sight might
seem to be an exception to our general condemnation
of riches. What is the real effect of money
spent by millionaires on philanthropic, scientific,
or social experiments, and even educational
endowments? Are we justified in hailing them
as wholly and unquestionably beneficent?</p>

<p>That they should spend their money this way
instead of on themselves must be acknowledged at
once as preferable and as a step in a better direction.
They gain immense applause from the world
by their deeds, although, of course, no sacrifice
whatever is involved. It is greatly to their
credit that their intelligence should prompt
them to attempt to benefit their fellows by a
national and scientific exploration of new ground
which may eventually lead to some permanent
benefit to the human race. But while granting
unreservedly the purity of their motives, we
shall by a more exact examination of the nature,
scope, and consequences of their action come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the following conclusions which amount to
objections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The choice of the particular experiment
and the decision as to whether it shall be embarked
on at all rests with one individual will.
The source of action therefore being an uncertain
quantity which cannot be depended upon,
this method of initiating works for the public
benefit is incapable of being organised, controlled,
or even relied upon. Indeed, millionaires are apt
to be like spoilt children unless they can have the
satisfaction of complete control over their exploits.</p>

<p>(2) The experiment selected may not be a wise
one or in conformity with the ideals of real betterment,
even though for a time it may receive the
formal sanction of popular approval.</p>

<p>(3) Even if the experiment is admittedly useful
and beneficial, it has a strong tendency to encourage
us, who constitute the community as a whole,
to think that as there are rich men who are sufficiently
enterprising and public-spirited to undertake
these schemes and works of general utility,
it is unnecessary to organise corporate effort, to
establish them ourselves. Moreover, there is limit
of productivity in private enterprise.</p>

<p>(4) There are social schemes carefully conceived
and elaborately worked out which fail because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
the very security of certain financial help and
support has the effect of weakening initiative,
choking enterprise, and preventing the growth
of the just pride and self-reliance which individuals
or bodies of individuals can only develop
in an independent struggle with the chances and
changes of their natural environment. Those
who are supposed to benefit by the scheme are in
fact, oppressed by the shadow of the heavy arm of
the financial subsidy which dominates the whole
situation. This may be unreasonable, but it is
quite natural, and it shows that money poured
out by one hand clogs the machinery of commercial
and industrial life, falls, so to speak, into clots
and cannot spread itself effectively as a lubricant
into the many narrow and unseen corners of the
domestic, municipal, or rural life and activities of
the people.</p>

<p>(5) Lastly, or it should have been said, primarily,
the paramount objection is that any good that
may come from the particular scheme or experiment
is completely outweighed by the wrong that
has been perpetrated and the injury that has
been inflicted, in countless ways and in numberless
directions, by the withdrawal from healthy circulation
and the accumulation of the very riches a
part of which is now being returned to the community
in this doubtful form.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
It would be ungenerous to deny that great care
and forethought have been exercised by the
millionaires who have determined to devote a
large part of their wealth to some great religious,
social, scientific, or artistic cause. Distinct benefits
have accrued from their action. But emphatically
this does not mean that surplus wealth
in individual hands can be used profitably. It
means that human ingenuity, intelligence, and
generous feeling can to some small extent mitigate
in one direction the constant and pressing evils
which the accumulation of riches has caused and
is causing in a vastly more extensive way.</p>

<p>Another example about which some doubt
might be expressed is that of a man struggling
with his family on an income well below the
limit, unable to develop his capacities and lead a
decently useful life because of the constant pinch
of want. Will not a gift of money which secures
him a competence without affluence, frees his
energies for higher work, and liberates him from
the sordid and painful trials of poverty, will not
such a gift be an unqualified advantage to him,
and will not, therefore, the giver of that money
be an exception to the axiom that superfluous
wealth cannot be well spent?</p>

<p>The gift and its acceptance are not the only
determining factors in the problem. If such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
case is quite fairly stated, it shows that the donor
was not giving part of his superfluous wealth,
taking the definition of superfluous which has
already been given. He is giving something
which, as it turns out, he personally has the capacity
to give in a profitable and fruitful manner,
and which perhaps involves a certain amount of
sacrifice on his part. This money therefore constitutes
part of his competence and the gift is
justifiable. But this can only be admitted to a
very restricted extent. He must use the utmost
discretion not to give too much, otherwise he will
overstep the mark of prudence. He may be encouraged
to make this gift too frequently and
less discriminatingly. In short, the number of
such cases, where the recipient is unmistakably
benefited by an isolated gift of money, are very
exceptional. If we are presupposing that our
donor has money to play with and that his gift is
made out of his superfluity, in this case, as in that
of the millionaire’s experiment, his balance is on
the wrong side, and more harm is being done by
the retention of his surplus than good is done by
his small, spasmodic endeavours at charitable help
and subsidy, even though now and then they may
be perfectly well directed.</p>

<p>Capital entrusted to companies, corporations,
municipalities, or in the possession of the State,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
need not, from the bare fact of its being held
conjointly by a number of people, be expended
in a wise way or on remunerative works. But
there is a very much better chance of its being
well spent in the long run, where there is practically
unlimited capacity in the joint efforts and
united talents of a number of people, where there
is disinterested control, and where that control
is itself far from supreme, being subject to the
direct supervision of electors or of the general
community. Remonstrance, appeal, or protest
in this case is always possible and effectual, but
when an individual is the only dispenser of the
funds, he is the sole arbiter and judge, has complete
and despotic power, and is not answerable
to any superior authority.</p>

<p>Further it cannot be seriously controverted
that money, circulating in small sums in the
hands of the mass of the people and devoted for
the most part to the purchase of the necessaries
of life, is infinitely more conducive to productive
expenditure than money hoarded in large quantities
to be administered by a small class for their
own advantage.</p>

<p class="hang b2">The deceptive process of the growth of riches—The relaxation

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> is no more misleading and deceptive
process than the gradual growth of riches.
As a man’s income increases, fresh obligations
arise which have all the appearance of necessities,
and in satisfying these a still further crop
springs up, demands his attention, and occupies
more of his time. Little by little his standard
changes; stage by stage, almost imperceptibly,
what he once regarded as a pure luxury becomes
to him an imperative necessity, and all unconscious,
he spends his energy in the struggle to
keep himself on a level with those among whom
he desires to be classed.</p>

<p>This is all very well with people whose means
range above the limit, but when we reach those
who are on the border line, when we come to the
ranks of those whose existence is overshadowed
by the constant and wearing anxiety as to whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
their small incomes will go far enough, there is
an element of profound tragedy in their efforts
to keep up appearances and to maintain an outward
show of having money while necessities,
unseen but very pressing, are sacrificed—the
service of doctors and nurses in illness very likely
denied, and all the small accessories that go to
make life in the home pleasanter cut off. We are
not aware of the large number of people thus
situated, because their brave attempts to delude
us are often successful. Those we know of have
perhaps seen better days, being through no fault
of their own thrown into penury, and they may
be making pathetic and painful endeavours to
keep up a show not, indeed, of affluence, but,
anyhow, of respectability. As a writer<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> recently
said with great truth: “There is little sympathy
felt in the world of rhetoric for the silent sufferings
of the genteel poor, yet there is no class
that deserves a more charitable commiseration.”
Their incomes may not be in themselves excessively
small, but the expense of conforming to
the various little conventions to which they have
been accustomed and the strain of trying to keep
up to a level slightly above their natural standard
eat away too much of their meagre store. Their
gentility has softened them, or their middle-class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
respectability prevents them from openly ranking
themselves among the poor. They know, too,
that a change in circumstances may deprive them
of their former “friends.”</p>

<p>The miseries of debt and bankruptcy may often
be the outcome of an extravagant or profligate
disposition, and need not be directly connected
with an excess or deficiency of means. But this
solicitude to obey the rigid, conventional, and
universally accepted measure for classing the
community according to their incomes, this
horror of dropping in the scale, is responsible for
much suffering and secret despair, especially
among women who have not been trained to
work and find themselves turned adrift on the
world with a bare pittance.</p>

<p>Higher in the scale, where there is an ample
competence, the amount spent on appearances is
frequently unreasonably excessive. The craving
to associate with people who are richer and the
fear of being thought badly off, knowing that
that is the equivalent of becoming socially a
pariah, produces a serious deficiency in the more
important needs of life, bitterness at the hardness
of fate, stinting, useless saving, and sometimes
eventual impoverishment and ruin.</p>

<p>But without having actually to face catastrophe,
these people, simply by the injudicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
and ill-managed administration of what they
have got, cannot live the full and decent lives
their circumstances allow them. This is true of
a very large well-to-do class who cry out for
more money while they are spending too large
a portion of what they have in things which, for
them, are unnecessary extravagances, but which
they cling to as indispensable.</p>

<p>They are probably slackening their exertions
in directions where they would be all the better
for a little extra stimulant in the shape of trouble
and effort. The constant easy satisfaction of
their small requirements has an enervating and
weakening effect on their character, and there is
neither charm nor adventure in their lives, for
there is a point when satisfaction almost suffocates.
Human nature is so constituted that
energy increases in proportion as it is used. The
more a man has to do, the more he wants to do,
the more he can do. All kinds of insignificant
little daily efforts keep the machine perpetually
in motion and in order, ready and alert for more
work, and the spirit of disinclination is shut out.
Relax those efforts, augment sensuous comforts,
and the machine will require starting and restarting,
with a continual extra spurt and additional
exertion. The spirit of disinclination
insinuates itself, and indolence and apathy creep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
in. It has been shown in the animal world that
the spoilt and carefully combed and washed pet
is far less intelligent than the animal who has to
look after himself, scratch his own fleas, and lick
the dirt off his paws. We are under the impression
that if we can get rid of the various irritations
of daily life, which are our fleas, the time spent
in scratching will be devoted to work of a higher
order more in conformity with our powers. But,
given the time, somehow we do not manage to
do the extra work. The ambition of every man
who acquires more money is not to increase the
field of personal activity, but, on the contrary,
to restrict it. The natural tendency is towards
ease rather than action. But as soon as men find
out that ease begets indifference and indolence
amounting to atrophy, and leading at last to a
cessation of the ordinary powers of enjoyment,
and that action is a spur to the faculties, making
them more alive, more sensitive, and more susceptible
to enthusiasm and appreciation, they
will be on their guard against the snares
and wiles that beset the path of everyone who
makes a special business of smoothing away all
the roughness in his domestic and social surroundings.</p>

<p>Spending money to save oneself trouble often
produces trouble and worry of a different and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
very likely more vexatious kind, and at the same
time reduces by that much the good effects on
the character produced by a certain amount of
bracing discipline and general tightening of the
reins of conduct. Precisely in the same way as
reducing hygienic or physical exercise diminishes
muscular efficiency. The recurring sense of accomplishment,
however trivial and apparently
insignificant that accomplishment may be, is invigorating
to the nature and of enduring value.
As Carlyle says in one of his letters to his future
wife: “Let us not despond in the life of honourable
toil which lies before us. Do you not think
that when you on one side of our household shall
have faithfully gone through your housewife’s
duties, and I on the other shall have written my
allotted pages, we shall meet over our frugal
meal with far happier and prouder hearts than
thousands that are not blessed with any duty
and whose agony is the bitterest of all, ‘the
agony of a too easy bed’?”</p>

<p>It is too much to ask that everyone should at
once recognise what sort of expenditure will
really be repaying and fill their lives with genuine
happiness and what is only empty, disappointing,
and superfluous. But they are wrong when they
suppose, as they so often do, that they are suffering
from want of money; and they are wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
in believing that more money will cure their
discontent. The problem for them is more than
half solved once they come to realise that they
are showing themselves to be incapable of the
responsibility they already possess, and that
more money would only mean an increase of
responsibilities without any fresh acquisition of
knowledge as to how to discharge them. All
around them they observe an implicit obedience
in small matters as well as great to what we may
call the law of gain. They join in obeying this
law, which is nothing more than an artificial
convention of an ill-organised society.</p>

<p>The word convention has frequently been used,
for it best describes the fixed authority for conduct
and ethics which has been set up by the
tacit consensus of public opinion, and which
people accept and obey without inquiry. This
force—for it amounts to a force—drives the
great body of uneducated, under-educated, and
ill-educated people, who never stop to inquire or
investigate. If a stick is put across a gap in a
hedge and a flock of sheep is driven through, the
first few sheep will jump the stick, and then, even
after the stick has been removed, the rest of the
flock will all jump when they come to the gap,
and not one will stop to see if there is any reason
or necessity for the jump. So it is with human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
beings, who find it easier to do as others do
rather than take the trouble to exercise any
separate powers of discrimination which might
convince them of the necessity of striking out a
different line of their own. One line of conduct
may suit a large number of individuals, but it is
inconceivable that it should suit all, and there is
a great revivification of the faculties in a man
when he first realises that what may be right
for others need not be right for him.</p>

<p>A lady once remarked, with a sigh, while
arranging her drawing-room, “One must have
a silver table,” meaning that a small table on
which could be displayed various gimcracks of
silver was a necessity of fashion in the disposition
of drawing-room furniture. If she had said, “I
won’t have a silver table,” or, “I’m going to have
twenty silver tables,” she would have been an
exceptional and original being exercising an independent
judgment at the risk of being thought
eccentric. But her only desire, and the only
desire of the majority of her fellows, is to conform.</p>

<p>Another cause of mischief is that most people
have their eyes turned towards those who are better
off than they are themselves, and they continually
and instinctively make mental comparisons
which serve only to increase their longing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
Seldom do they turn their eyes to the millions
who are less fortunate in the way of wealth and
make comparisons in that direction, else they
might come to the unpleasant conclusion that
they have themselves already more than enough,
and perhaps too much. To live simply they
foolishly suspect means something disagreeable,
unattractive, tedious, and arduous; whereas if
they only gave it a trial, they might find that
the very simplification of their manner of living
would set free their energies and attract them
to new and absorbing interests, and a kind of
happiness might become theirs which far surpasses
in intensity the greatest pleasures wealth
ever bought, and which, instead of being transitory
and ephemeral, is lasting.</p>

<p>“The superior worth of simplicity of life,”
says J. S. Mill, “the enervating and demoralising
effect of the trammels and hypocrisies of artificial
society, are ideas which have never been
entirely absent from cultivated minds since
Rousseau wrote; and they will in time produce
their effect, though at present needing to be
asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by
deeds, for words on this subject have nearly exhausted
their power.”</p>

<p>Asceticism, pedantry, intentional unconventionality,
and the affected “simple life” have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
all served to damage the force of the arguments
in favour of plain living; and it is often supposed
that it is jealousy of the rich that causes the
occasional outbursts against luxury. But anyone
who can watch for a moment and analyse social
phenomena will very soon come to the conclusion
that there is nothing in the lives of the rich of
which anyone need be envious. Millionaires
themselves are the first to admit that their money
brings them no happiness. The confession has
been made by one of them that the very fact
of being able without the least difficulty to
satisfy his smallest or his largest fancies was in
itself the very antithesis of pleasure. He had
learnt that the continuous craving to satisfy
human wants, far from being a misfortune, constituted
an intrinsic element in the production
of happiness. The hope perhaps long deferred,
that some particular want might eventually be
satisfied was a treasure he had for ever lost
the power to appreciate. It is delay, and not
immediate satisfaction, that enhances the value
of acquisition. “Millionaires who laugh are
rare,” says Andrew Carnegie.</p>

<p>Superabundance, surfeit, the cloying sweetness
of excess, the consequent lack of restraint and
reserve must encourage the development of moral
sickness, nausea, and intellectual inertia. In all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
professions, arts, trades, and crafts the fixing of a
limit within which to operate is the secret of the
attainment of a high quality of work because it is
the recognition of human limitations. The same
principle holds good for every human being in
the administration of his worldly possessions and
the management of his own life. Economy
should be the key-note rather than profusion,
strength lies in reserve rather than in excess.</p>

<p>We are only saying to a man who is sitting
before a table laden with a vast quantity of different
dishes heaped with all kinds of appetising
foods: “Being an ordinary mortal your digestion
will not stand more than a limited quantity of
that food. If you continually eat more than what
is good for you, you will be ill. A certain amount
of food will nourish you, a larger amount will
simply make you sick. We do not say your food
is too good, nastier food would be better for you,
nor do we say that you must never have a feast:
but we assure you that if you habitually gorge
the surfeit will injure your digestive powers,
will destroy your own enjoyment of the meal,
and at the same time, by this thoughtless waste,
you are depriving many who have an insufficient
quantity of what is rightfully theirs. In any case,
you can never manage to eat all these dishes by
yourself. What good are they to you? To propose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
that you should be relieved of some of your
superfluity is the suggestion of a friend and not
of an enemy. Just reflect as you see this huge meal
spread before you that the great majority of your
fellow-men have not more than one meagre and
inadequate dish.” He would probably reply:
“I am the best judge of what is good for me.
The food is mine. If I do not eat it I am not
going to allow anyone to deprive me of it, but I
can always give part of it away if and when I feel
inclined”—and he will continue with a dull gaze
of satiated weariness to regard the piles of food
before him.</p>

<p>This is a fair metaphor, because we have all
been forced to learn the precise nature of our
limitations with regard to the consumption of
food. Is it unreasonable to hope that in time we
may become as conscious of our limitations in the
consumption of other materials no less important?</p>

<p>If the rich protest that they have a perfect
right to amass what fortune they like, and that it
is tyranny and an infringement of their liberty to
deny them this right, they can be told plainly
that their liberty will only be respected if they
in their turn will respect the liberty of others,
which cannot be effectually secured except by
restraining license. As it is, they are manifestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
depriving others of their liberty and elementary
rights by the outrageous license they now allow
themselves. No one cries out louder than a rich
man if by any chance he loses part of his fortune.
The reduction of his income from fifty to
thirty, or from twenty to ten thousand a year
is a catastrophe for which he unceasingly asks
the sympathy and commiseration of his friends.
The dismissal of the second footman is a
hardship which requires courage to face, the
sale of a corner of the estate is the sign of
ruin! He stands in striking contrast to those
who, having to face genuine poverty, often show
fortitude and pluck in the face of bitter misfortunes.</p>

<p>But as an excuse for the rich man it ought
frankly to be acknowledged that his life is made
extremely complex and difficult. If this much
alone were apparent to him he might pause in
his eager chase. A man with work, with a profession
or trade, a woman with a profession or
with house and parental duties, not only have
their time occupied, but have their thoughts
filled and have fewer alternatives of conduct,
while at the same time they are not freed from
the conflicting obligations which make every life
a serious problem. But the rich man has before
him unlimited alternatives without any constraint.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
He has to invent and conceive for himself
his sphere of usefulness and select the particular
form of occupation he thinks will suit him.
He suffers from misgivings in embarking on one
form of activity, that he might have done better
to choose another. If he is not careful, idle business,
the inevitable outcome of his estates, his
establishments, his social duties, and other appurtenances
of his elaborate entourage will take up
the greater part of his time and absorb all his
thoughts. However conscientiously he may
desire to encourage works of utility and throw
himself into profitable pursuits, he must find
himself embarrassed not only with his load of
wealth, but with the limitless horizon before him,
the entire absence of any disciplinary compulsion,
and the withdrawal of the restraints which shield
the course of a simpler life. Not only is the
volume of water larger, but there is no river
bed. The shifting action of the stream, therefore,
is far more likely to be devastating than
fertilising.</p>

<p>Waste and loss will everywhere be found in
money’s trail. Talents which under free, unhampered
conditions might have grown and
blossomed have been withered under this golden
blight. Many men and women might have done
valuable work and even attained great achievements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
had they been compelled to work for a
living, to toil, to labour, and to strive instead of
being choked with the glut of riches. With a
very few exceptions, men in the creative arts and
in science have not been men who by any standard
could be described as rich. The greatest treasures
the world possesses in painting, music, literature,
poetry, and architecture are gifts from men who
were never burdened with great possessions. No
genius, no creative spirit, no hungry inquirer,
no philosopher can exist in the hot-house atmosphere
and cramping conditions which surround
riches.</p>

<p>On the other hand, extreme poverty has very
much the same effect, killing the too sensitive
and fragile spirit in its exertions to be free, wasting
what might be a useful and perhaps remarkable
life, and forcing men of high powers to stoop
to the prostitution of their talents in order to
gain enough for their very subsistence. But in
the latter case, anyhow, the fight is a great and
vigorous combat for existence which a man must
take up or perish, and which, if he succeeds, equips
him with strengthened faculties and a richer
experience for the further stages on his life’s
journey. Poverty is merciless and cruel, but it
cannot be denied that it is a far better teacher
than riches. The contest with money has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
stimulating effects, it weakens and paralyses a
man’s moral and intellectual fibre, stunts and
smothers his finer ambitions, and if he has the
unusual strength of character to free himself, it
can only be done by casting from him deliberately
and finally his self-imposed burden.</p>

<p>Art, literature, and music are all suffering
severely from the financial taint known as commercialism,
which tends to popularise second-rate
work, degrade the public taste, and steepen
the already stiff path chosen by those who are
aiming at a high standard of workmanship rather
than popular recognition. “Will it pay?” is a
colloquialism as general in use as remarks about
the weather.</p>

<p>When compared with other nations, it would
seem that we in England are more deeply infected
with this belief in money than they are elsewhere.
Our very prosperity, generally described in figures
of material expansion, may account for this. The
more money there is in circulation, the more
chance there is for larger quantities of it to get
lodged in a single pocket, the keener becomes the
competition to acquire it, the stronger is the
power, the influence, and the example of rich
men.</p>

<p>America cannot be very far behind, where
comment is now being made on cases of insanity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
and the suicidal mania among the children and
descendants of very rich people, brought about by
the mental and nervous strain and exhaustion to
which multi-millionaires are subjected in their
mad race for wealth. It produces in the children
what they call over there “the money
twist” in the brain. Nevertheless, in his survey
of English life the American writer already quoted
says, “The struggle to get it (money) is unparalleled
anywhere else in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> And
this was also the verdict of one who wrote a few
years ago with an intimate knowledge of Continental
life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is no nation in the world that has so
acute a sense of the value, almost the necessity of
wealth for human intercourse as the English
nation.... In England they silently accept the
maxim, ‘a large income is a necessary of life,’ and
they class each other according to the scale of
their establishments, looking up with unfeigned
reverence to those who have many servants, many
horses, and gigantic houses, where great hospitality
is dispensed.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the economic structure, just as in an architectural
structure, what should be aimed at is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
proper relation between weights and supports.
One section of our social building is too heavily
weighted and there is an unnecessary waste of
material in supplying the adequate supports and
buttresses to meet the stress, which is all on the
one side. It is this want of balance and disproportionate
pressure which tends very materially
to imperil the whole edifice.</p>

<p>Does it amount to a national danger? and if
so, how can it be warded off? are questions
that may well be asked. But this would carry
us too far and involve a discussion as to the
extent to which legislation or taxation or an
improved system of education might shield us
from any risks. It lies outside the scope of our
present argument, which must be confined to
demonstrating the existence and universal nature
of the passion, its unjustifiable claims and evil
consequences.</p>

<p>How to put a stop to the waste caused by an
unproductive surplus getting piled up in the
hands of the rich is nevertheless admitted by
modern economists to be a matter that urgently
needs solution. “The principal problem of
modern industrial civilisation,” says Mr. J. A.
Hobson, “consists in devising measures to secure
that the whole of the industrial surplus shall be
economically applied to the purposes of industrial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and social progress instead of passing in the shape
of unearned increment to the owners of the
factors of production whose activities are depressed,
not stimulated by such payments.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">The problem of riches—Necessity for scientific investigation
into the lives of the rich—Interdependence of riches and
poverty—Analysis of expenditure on houses, servants, clothes,
food, amusements—Impressions of a poor crowd and a rich
crowd—Tragedies.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">On</span> all sides it is admitted that there is a
problem of Poverty, but it has never yet
been suggested that just in the same way there
is a problem of Riches. Not the problem of
how to become rich and how to invest money
and make more money, that is the very obsession
which ought to be dispelled, but the important
question of how the rich spend their money,
how they live, to what objects they devote their
riches, and whether the vast accumulations are
being disposed of to the greatest advantage. The
connection between riches and poverty is capable
of proof, that is to say, the maladministration
of wealth by individuals can be shown to be
closely linked to the disorganisation of labour
which creates such evils as sweating and unemployment.
But before further advance can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
be made towards any possible solution there
must be a dissection and analysis of the lives of
the rich as well as of the poor, so that some
knowledge may be acquired of both sides of the
medal which will demonstrate their interdependence.</p>

<p>We are allowed to extract every conceivable
detail of the most intimate nature from the
poor householder, but any sort of inquiry as to
how the rich live is regarded as an impertinence.
Even the suggestion that they should make a
return of all their income, as a man of moderate
means must do for income tax purposes, is
scouted as inquisitorial.</p>

<p>We inquire into the lives of the poor in order
to ascertain the actual facts, so that with a full
knowledge of the evil we may set to work scientifically
to improve their condition. But this is
really only half the problem. No investigation
can be complete unless an equally careful and
exhaustive inquiry is made into the way the
rich live. It cannot be regarded as an inquisitive
prying into personal and private habits, for when
the expenditure is on such a scale as to have
extensive economic consequences it ceases to be
of a private nature and ought to be investigated
on public grounds. Not only might the inquiry
be made with a view to the improvement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
their own way of living—though they would
refuse to admit there was any room for improvement—but
by this means more light would also
be thrown on the problem of poverty.</p>

<p>It is the question of distribution that is
admittedly the insoluble difficulty, and yet we
set to work to examine the barren patches and
leave out of account the land that is soured by
over-fertilisation. To accomplish a successful
work of irrigation attention must not only be
turned to the dry and arid land, but to the
marshy, low-lying parts that have got more
of the water than they need and require draining,
otherwise an even flow over the whole can
never be engineered and the full capacity of the
soil cannot be given a fair chance.</p>

<p>It is absurd to suppose that any section of the
community, whatever pretensions they may have,
can live as they like without affecting the lives
and wellbeing of their fellow-men. Riches may
set up a fence, make those inside it believe that
they are living in a world apart and blind them
to what is going on outside, but riches have no
power to sever the moral and spiritual, as well
as the invisible economic ties which bind every
individual from his birth to his death with the
whole of the rest of humanity. This attitude
of aloofness which the rich adopt makes it true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
to say of them that “they are outcasts and are
cut off from natural and human relationship
with the great mass of mankind.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The people
who consider the richness of the rich has nothing
to do with the poverty of the poor are in the
habit of asserting that even if all incomes large
and small were added together there would not
be enough “to go round.” They fail to remember
that money which is invested without any
return, or only getting a very low return, has not
the same value and cannot go as far as the same
sum bringing in a high return from a remunerative
investment.</p>

<p>The attacks of a vaguely disparaging nature
made against the rich are often beside the mark
from the lack of accurate knowledge of their
position, their habits, and their methods. But
ought not the expenditure of these accumulated
masses of money to be subjected to some scientific
scrutiny? Can another “Personal Service Association”
be established among the poor for visiting
the rich? It is just as necessary. Can a supplement
be compiled to Mr. Charles Booth’s <cite>Life and
Labour of the People</cite>, Mr. Rowntree’s <cite>Poverty: a
Study of Town Life</cite>?</p>

<p>What would be the fate of an investigator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
who dared to pursue his inquiries at houses in
Mayfair or Belgravia? In response to the bell
the massive front door would slowly open, and
out of the darkness of the hall would emerge
the solemn figure of an overfed butler flanked
by two giants with powdered hair. The investigator,
note-book in hand, if he had the courage
to proceed, would ask his string of queries as to
how many rooms the house contained, how many
people, the cost of living, the health of the
children, the employment of the man, etc. etc.
But he would not get very far before the incensed
and outraged dignity of his audience
would take an active form and he would
find himself hurled down the steps into the
street.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, such a book would be of enormous
use. It would serve to establish a concrete
basis from which useful economic and sociological
deductions might be made, however disagreeable
some of the disclosures might be incidentally.
It would not be an invitation to the masses to
spoil and rob the rich any more than the books
on Poverty are an invitation to the rich to
largess more of their wealth among the poor.
Indeed, there is no question of spoliation, it is
all a matter of adjustment. The blame cast on
the rich would no doubt be heavy because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
have the power of initiative, education, and free
choice to act differently, while the poor are
merely the slaves of the overwhelming force of
circumstances and the victims of a system which
they have neither the intelligence to understand
nor the power to resist.</p>

<p>The following authentic information, based
on actual facts and not hearsay, will give some
small idea of what this suggested investigation
might produce. Extracts are also given from
reports on the state of the poor for the sake of
completeness rather than contrast.</p>

<p>For instance, we read a brief description of
the household of a man of “no occupation”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Married. Two rooms; two children; parish
relief; ill, incapable. Two little girls, one
consumptive. The rooms are miserable, badly
ventilated and damp. This house shares one
closet with six other houses, and one water tap
with three others.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Or of a “regular loafer”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Married. Two rooms; one child. Wife
sews. House very dark on account of high
buildings opposite. Kept tidy and clean. This
house shares one closet with two other houses,
and one water tap with six others.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Surely we ought to know the description,
though it cannot be so brief, of the household
of another man of “no occupation”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Married. Two children. Four houses.
London house, —— Street, W. Sixty-two
rooms; one of the country houses considerably
larger. Thirty-six indoor servants:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
1 house steward.<br />
2 grooms of the chamber.<br />
1 valet.<br />
2 under butlers.<br />
3 footmen.<br />
2 steward’s room footmen.<br />
1 gate porter.<br />
1 hall porter.<br />
1 usher of the servants’ hall.<br />
2 odd men.<br />
1 house carpenter.<br />
1 chef.<br />
1 kitchen porter.<br />
4 kitchen and scullery maids.<br />
2 still-room maids.<br />
6 housemaids.<br />
1 linen maid.<br />
1 lady’s maid.<br />
1 housekeeper.<br />
2 nurses.
</p>

<p>Owns about 20,000 acres of land. (A larger
staff of servants than this could be quoted. In
one country house as many as ten housemaids
are kept.)”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Or let us take the inhabitants of a six-roomed
house:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Ground floor, in the front room lives a
widow who does repairing and is very poor. The
back room is occupied by two prostitutes. On
the first floor front room live man and wife with
seven children. He loafs and she washes. They
are very dirty and miserably poor. At the back
live a man and woman with two children. He
is consumptive and does nothing in particular.
She goes out begging with the children. On the
top floor in two rooms are man and wife with
eight children. He spends his time about the
public-houses. She does anything she can. The
eldest boy, a decent lad, is at a chemist’s shop,
but he is consumptive. Six rooms; twenty-six
people.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The occupation of twenty-six of the people
who live in another house containing seventy-two
rooms is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Butler (wages £120),<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> valet, groom of the
chambers, under butler, three footmen, one
steward’s room footman, usher of the servants’
hall, odd man, chef (wages £150),<a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> kitchen
porter, four kitchen and scullery maids, five
housemaids, two still-room maids, one lady’s
maid, one needlewoman, one housekeeper.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
This staff ministers to the wants of a man, his
wife, and three children.</p>

<p>In the country, at a stone’s throw from one
another, we find a man, a farm labourer, living
with his wife and six children in a four-roomed
cottage on 14s. a week, and another man, without
any permanent employment, living with his wife
and a staff of twenty-three indoor servants in a
house containing over sixty rooms, with the
choice of two other large country houses and a
London house, and owning over 50,000 acres of
land, a great deal of which is kept for shooting.</p>

<p>In another part of the country the medical
officer of the county reports: “In a house consisting
of living-room, bedroom, and a small
scullery live father, mother, three sons, also
three children under ten and two men lodgers.
Seven sleep in the bedroom, which has a low
ceiling and has been divided, and five sleep in the
living-room; the only window of the latter
room will not open, and the window of the
divided upstairs room is near the floor level.”</p>

<p>The landlord and lord of the manor of this district
lives with his wife and family in a house containing
over one hundred rooms, and is attended
by a staff of forty-four indoor servants. He
has the choice of three other country residences
and a town house, and owns over 186,000 acres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
We find some women occupied in the following
way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mrs. B. and her daughter support themselves
on shirt work. The mother is a shirt finisher, the
daughter a machinist. They work seven or
eight hours a day—the daughter’s book shows
an average of 11s. 3¾d. over four weeks—the
mother’s 9s. 1d. over nine weeks. When the
mother earns 10s. it means working from 5:30
a.m. till 10 or 11 p.m. She gets 2d. per dozen
for finishing, i.e. 72 buttons and 48 bars.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Or:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mrs. C. is always busy mending, making,
washing, or baking, and certainly makes the best
of all that comes in her way. She states that she
can never afford money for recreation or for a
holiday out of the town.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">While others are occupied as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Early cup of tea, one hour for dressing, late
breakfast, writing notes, two hours shopping, half
an hour for dressing, one hour for luncheon (three
courses), drive, pay or receive calls, quarter of an
hour for dressing, one and a half hour for tea and
gossip, an hour’s rest, one hour for dressing, one
and a half hour for dinner (six courses); theatre,
ball, or bridge; supper, bed.</p></blockquote>

<p>We might have hit upon the day in the week
on which an hour or so was devoted to an “intellectual”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
lecture or a committee meeting for
some charity.</p>

<p>The annual average estimates of clothing are
instructive:</p>

<p>A normal case has been purposely chosen. The
budget might have been given of a man who has
ten evening suits, spends £10 a month on gloves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
and ties, and pays 25s. apiece for his pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of clothes, one or
two extracts may be quoted concerning those
who help to make them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mrs. —— gets 2s. 6d. a dozen for making coats
and 2s. 3d. a dozen for reefers, and says ten
years ago she got 5s. a dozen; eighteen years
ago 1s., 1s. 6d., and 2s. a coat; and in her early
days, when most of the work was done by hand,
5s. a coat.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. K. makes artificial flowers when she can
get work. When visited, she was working at
sprays with twenty-four small flowers, leaves,
and stem, at 1½d. per spray.”</p>

<p>“Miss B. makes elaborate net blouses with
tucks and insertion for 1s. to 1s. 4d. each. The
wholesale price for these blouses is 8s. 11d., and
the retail price 12s. to 15s.”</p>

<p>“A maker of pyjamas was paid 11s. 3d. for
entirely making a dozen suits, but gave up the
work and took to shirt-making, because the employer
found someone who would do it for
6s. 3d.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Food offers, perhaps, the most striking study.
In making this analysis it would almost seem
necessary to remember that the cubic capacity
of the adult human stomach does not vary to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
appreciable extent, and, on the whole, appetite
is liable to be keener with those who endure
physical toil than with those who do nothing.
Again, no extreme instances, one way or the
other, will be given.</p>

This dinner for twenty people cost £60, or £3
a head, without wine.</p>

<p>If the figures in these instances, with regard
to food expenditure, really represented quantities
consumed, the dangers from overfeeding in
the one set of cases would far exceed the dangers
from underfeeding in the other. The cheerful
bell that announces the servants’ midday meal
no doubt heralds the consumption of a vast
amount of food; but it is a debatable point
whether sheer waste does not account for almost
as much. Quarts of cream are emptied down the
sink, joints and birds only half eaten are thrown
away, and the pig-tub receives a rich enough
allowance of vegetables, fruit, and cakes to
satisfy the appetite of a large family. In fact,
in one house, where the household books averaged
£63 a week, the matter was looked into, and a
reduction was made to £34 without any diminution
in the number of servants.</p>

<p>Dancing is a form of amusement appreciated
by all classes.</p>

<p>At —— Hall, Fulham, and many other similar
places the tickets for the Saturday night dance cost
9d. each. If two hundred people are present, the
cost would be £7 10s.; allowing 3d. a head for refreshments
(£2 10s.), the total amount will be £10.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
At —— Hotel, S.W., a ball was given lately
for two hundred people, costing £1237.</p>

<p>Granting that the amount of enjoyment derived
from these two entertainments is equal,
though in all probability there would be more
genuine and honest pleasure in the former than
in the latter, the two sums simply represent the
different standards of living. That ten or even
twenty times as much may be spent to give
people who are accustomed to a higher scale of
living the same amount of pleasure is perhaps
intelligible, but it seems to require a sum which
amounts to one hundred and twenty-three times
as much.</p>

health also. Poor old mother used to work very
hard for years at the wash-tub, but her strength

the utter blankness of the faces that looked up
at us from the pavement or down on us from
the windows, with scarcely enough capacity for
human interest to wonder who we were and
what we wanted. Never a sign of humour.
Stooped shoulders, hollow chests, ash-coloured
faces, lightless eyes, and, ghastliest of all, mouths
with bloodless gums and only here and there a
useful tooth. Literally hundreds of women
between seventeen and seventy crowded close
to our motor-cars that day, and the marks were
on them all.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p></blockquote>

the four hundred that come after you are sitting,

unseeing eyes. Resented while you gathered
being; brought into the world with the most
distinguished skill; remembered by your mother
when the whim came to her; taught to believe
that life consists in caring for your clean, well-nourished
body and your manner that nothing
usual can disturb; taught to regard Society as
the little ring of men and women that you see,
and to feel your business is to know the next
thing that you want and get it given you; you
have never had a chance. Sitting there in your
seven hundred carriages you are blind—in heart
and soul and voice and walk—the blindest creatures
in the world ... and you are charming

label ‘Blind.’ The cut of your gown is perfect,
the dressing of your hair the latest, the trimming
of your hat later still; your tricks of speech the

<p>If the suggested volume, <cite>The Life and
Leisure of some People</cite>, or <cite>Riches: a Study

eloquent enough by itself.</p>

Mr. Rowntree concludes his book with this

during a time of, perhaps, unexampled prosperity,
probably more than a quarter of the
population are living in poverty is a fact that
may well cause great searchings of heart.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This might be paraphrased:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That in this land, where more than a quarter
of the population are living in poverty, the
abounding wealth of the country should be retained
by a comparatively small number of
people, who squander their riches in a way that
brings no happiness to themselves and inflicts
misery and hardships on others, is a fact that
may well cause great searchings of heart.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The</span> religion we profess has for one of its
most significant and salient features the
denunciation of wealth as a trust or a pursuit:
Christianity condemns riches as a snare, a danger,
and almost a sin, and even Pagan-nurtured sages
and statesmen are never weary of pointing out
how this disastrous passion vitiates all our estimates
of life and its enjoyments, and fosters and
exasperates all our social sores. Yet in England
and America, perhaps the two most sincerely
Christian nations in the world—one the cradle,
the other the offspring of Puritanism—the pursuit
nearest to a universal one, the passion likest
to a national one is money-getting; not the
effort after competence or comfort, but the pushing,
jostling, trampling struggle for vast possessions
or redundant affluence.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The above is a quotation from the <cite>Enigmas of
Life</cite>, by W. R. Greg. He wrote this in 1873,
and the passage goes on to observe that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
were signs of a sounder perception which might
herald a reaction against the struggle for money.
His forecast, however, was wrong, for even in the
last thirty years the scramble has become much
wilder, the power of wealth greater, the influence
of the wealthy more extensive, and the millionaire
more common, while luxurious living has
outstripped all reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>The Christian condemnation of riches remains
as emphatic as when it was first uttered, but the
Church continues to explain it away or to disregard
it, and the clergy as a whole neither
preach it nor do they attempt to practise the
doctrine laid down by their Master. The clergy
of the Church of England, in fact, are among the
readiest to accept the hierarchy of modern
society founded on the gradations and valuations
of wealth. Even in the village churches the very
seats are assigned in such a way as to acknowledge
the worldly standard of means. The front rows
are reserved for the squires and their dependents,
the “gentry” behind them, the “poor” at the
back; while the vicar inconsistently declares
from the pulpit that they are all equal in the
sight of God. The Church as a profession (every
decade it becomes more of a profession and less of
a calling) is arranged on the ordinary worldly
system of increase of salary according to rank and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
promotion. And, indeed, if it were suggested to
them that an increase of their spiritual practically
implied and necessitated a decrease of their
material responsibilities, and that the performance
of the former is by their own testimony interfered
with by the existence of the latter, with a very
few exceptions they would scoff at such a fanciful
idea.</p>

<p>If confronted with the words of the Gospel on
the subject of riches, they shuffle and seek excuses
by declaring that they are figurative, and
that they point to an ideal which unfortunately
is unpractical and not compatible with our
modern social system, which in its highly “civilised”
development has got beyond extreme and
uncompromising maxims of that kind. But we
cannot get beyond what is eternally true, nor
surely should we desist from some attempt to
reach forward towards it, however unattainable
and distant the ideal may seem. Whatever
doubts Christians may have as to what Christ’s
meaning was in some of His preaching, there can
be no two opinions as to His view on this point.
There is diametrical opposition between His injunctions
and our belief. The world says nothing
makes life easier than to have money and possessions;
Christianity says nothing makes life more
difficult. As a body the clergy see nothing incongruous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
in taking up this stand on the side of
the rich; they overlook their consequent estrangement
from the poor, and they ignore the
fact that they are gradually drifting away from
any close contact and sympathy with the life
and soul of the people. The elasticity of their
religion has amounted in this case, as in others,
to its distortion.</p>

<p>Long before the Christian era philosophers
propounded this same doctrine, and many reformers
have done so since. As a single instance
we need only repeat the words of Sir Thomas
More:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“For where is the justice that noblemen, goldsmiths,
and usurers and those classes who either
do nothing at all or in what they do are of no
great service to the commonwealth, should live
a genteel and splendid life in idleness or unproductive
labour; whilst in the meantime the
servant, the waggoner, the mechanic, and the
peasant toiling almost longer and harder than
the horse, in labour so necessary that no commonwealth
could endure a year without it, lead a life
so wretched that the condition of the horse
seems more to be envied?... Thus after careful
reflection, it seems to me, as I hope for mercy,
that our modern republics are nothing but a
conspiracy of the rich pursuing their own selfish
interests under the name of a republic. They
devise and invent all ways and means whereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
they may, in the first place, secure to themselves
the possession of what they have amassed by evil
means; and in the second place, secure to their
own use and profit the work and labour of the
poor at the lowest possible price.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Would he find words to express himself were he
alive to-day?</p>

<p>But of them all no one has emphasised so
clearly or insisted so strongly on the vanity and
danger of worldly goods as Christ did.</p>

<p>The rich man consults Him, and tells Him that
all the chief commandments he has observed from
his youth. But Christ sees what is amiss, and the
man goes away grieving, “For he had great
possessions.” Then follows the great generalisation:
“How hardly shall they that have riches
enter into the Kingdom of God. It is easier for
a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”
As to whether or not the “needle’s eye” was the
name of a narrow gate of the city through which
heavily laden camels could not pass, does not
signify. The meaning is clear beyond question.
In the Kingdom of God upon earth, that is an
ideally constituted human society, there is no
place for a man encumbered with riches; his
presence would assuredly disturb the even balance
of the whole. Rousseau saw that it was a condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
of good government that no citizen should
be rich enough to buy another, and no citizen
poor enough to be compelled to sell himself.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
If all the social organisation of humanity, the
arrangement of which rests apparently to a great
extent in our control, were so constituted as to
allow each man a full competence, far from its
producing a deadening equality as some pretend,
it would free the human race to make the most
of its varied natural capacities and talents which
are now mostly lost, and a competition of achievement
and service founded on altruism would
take the place of a competition for gain and
profit based on egoism. The ideal may be unattainable
for the present because we have
drifted so far from it, but that is no reason for
discarding it altogether and turning our faces in
the exactly opposite direction.</p>

<p>There are many other equally noteworthy
sayings in the Gospels, staled by custom and
familiar to most of us in the same way as the
Church service becomes familiar to children
without their understanding one single syllable
of what it all means.</p>

<p>“Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth, where the moth and rust corrupt, and
where thieves break through and steal.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
again, “The seeds that fell among thorns, and
the thorns grew up and choked them, and they
yielded no fruit. These are such as hear the
Word, and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness
of riches and the lust of other things
entering in, choke the Word and it becometh unfruitful.”
And yet again the parable of the rich
man and Lazarus. These are not mere fantastic
and rhetorical figures of speech, but are a few of
the many instances of the reiterated insistence on
the supreme importance of the dispersal of the
riches heaped in the hands of the few. It is
needless to multiply texts to prove that it is
one of the cardinal doctrines of Christ’s teaching.
He was profoundly impressed with the impediment,
the handicap, the burden of wealth, the
undischargeable responsibility which weighs men
down and incapacitates them from participating
in a juster and more perfect arrangement of
society. And down through the ages many a
great mind has strongly endorsed this lasting
truth which, let it be remembered, though the
world is blind to it, is as strictly utilitarian as it is
moral.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the least complex about this
teaching. It is almost self-evident; far easier
to teach and far simpler to preach than the
intricate speculative tangles of dogma which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
cast like nets from pulpits over the minds of
congregations. But there is this difference, that
while the latter is only an intellectual effort on
the part of the preacher or on the part of some
other divine who has prompted him, the renunciation
of worldly riches cannot be preached
by any man who makes no attempt to practise it.</p>

<p>The clergy are like the rest of us, they do not
really believe in it; they cannot therefore act as
if they did; they are persuaded in their inmost
hearts that to be richer must mean to be happier,
and so they take refuge in what is for their congregations
the less comprehensible and for themselves,
therefore, the less embarrassing side of
their religion. Accordingly, from our moral
physicians we can get no guidance, on the contrary,
with a very few notable exceptions, they encourage
the fallacious belief in money-making, and
slur over this important part of Christ’s message.
Why did He associate with the poor and choose
His disciples from among their ranks? Not because
He hoped to enrich them, but because their
deficiency in worldly goods made them fertile
ground for the seed of His doctrine of self-sacrifice
and humility. If we reject His teaching, well
and good, we can discard this with the rest, but
it is just those who do the most lip service to
dogmatic Christianity who calmly ignore this
unqualified essential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
It would be unfair to insist that no Churchmen
are aware of these dangers. Occasionally a voice
speaks out boldly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We are not in touch with the mass of the
labouring people,” says the Bishop of Birmingham.
“Is not the reason of this because we are the
Church of the rich rather than of the poor—of
capital rather than of labour? By this I mean
that in the strata of Society the Church works
from above rather than from below. The opinions
and the prejudices that are associated with its
administration as a whole are the opinions and
prejudices of the higher and higher middle
classes rather than of the wage earners....
Capital and labour are names now for great class
interests and organisations representing men in
many, and the Church finds itself in fact and on
the whole moving in the grooves which are precisely
those from which Christ warned us off:
it finds itself expressing the point of view which
is precisely not that which Christ chose for His
Church.... Our whole system of Church
charity expresses a bounty administered out of
benevolent feeling, by a wealth which makes no
apology for enjoying itself to a poverty which
it makes no pretence to share.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Or the Bishop of Manchester to the Church
Congress in 1908:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p><blockquote>

<p>“I suggest that our religious revival may lead
us to a new appreciation of the spirit of brotherhood—one
of the great ideals of the democratic
movement. Secondly, I suggest that our religious
revival may take the form of a mission to the
wealthy and prosperous. It is the curse of riches
that they blur and even conceal altogether the
heavenly vision. They tend to make pleasure
the business of life. A man’s wealth is measured
by the time and money that he can spend on
amusement. So the outlook, not only of the
rich, but of all classes, becomes narrowed and
confused.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And of course other instances could be quoted,
but the main body of the Church shows no disposition
to follow. They are bound to the
governing classes, and the governing classes have
the money and therefore the power such as it is.</p>

<p>The Free Churches on the whole are bolder,
for they deal with a simpler class. But neither
do they tirelessly condemn money-hunting, because,
being poor themselves, they are far too
dependent on the large subscriptions of the
richer members of their congregations. But not
even by building chapels can a rich man justify
himself, though he may be blessed as a benefactor
by his co-religionists.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholics too, who anyhow in
their churches do not give any special privileges
to rank, have their tongues tied by the lavish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
donations of rich and noble patrons which they
are only too glad to receive. To emphasise
the Christian condemnation of the rich man
would therefore not be politic or in accordance
with what they conceive to be their best
interests.</p>

<p>It is not as if Christians of all sects and denominations
could not discover texts and arguments
enough in their Bibles to support them were they
to alter this course and advance courageously
along the straight way. The best words ever
uttered on the evil and folly of riches are to be
found in its pages in the Old Testament as well
as the New. A collection of these sayings would
form the strongest indictment of wealth that
could be framed.</p>

<p>There is the great Proverb, “A good name is
rather to be sought than great riches, and loving
favour rather than silver and gold.” Or the passage
from Job, “Though he heap up silver as the
dust and prepare raiment as the day, he may prepare
it, but the just shall put it on and the innocent
shall divide the silver,” and “Will he
esteem thy riches? No, not gold nor all the
forces of strength.” Or the Psalmist’s warning,
“If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.”
Or the words of Ecclesiastes, “There is a sore
evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
riches kept for the owners thereof to their
hurt.”</p>

<p>But we must resist the temptation of making
a collection of quotations here. The declarations
of this truth are well known, even though they
may not be accepted or appreciated. The truth
about money may still be looked upon as impracticable
Utopianism; one day it may be
discovered to be sound economics. The practice
of restraint and renunciation is not only theoretically
sound, but both subjectively and objectively
expedient.</p>

<p>There is, we must confess, a recurring
note in modern thought, the constant use of
which is amounting almost to a popular mannerism.
It is a method of reasoning which
inclines men to spurn deep convictions or strong
single-minded purpose as clumsy, uncouth, and
unphilosophic, and to welcome in their place
involved generalisations and a spirit of abstract
compromise and theoretical balancing. Whether
this tends to a more profound acquisition of
knowledge and a more exact and scientific adjustment
of mental conceptions, is not for us to
say, but that it casts a weakening spell over personal
initiative and greatly impedes decisive
action is clear beyond doubt.</p>

<p>As for the Church, it is failing in its mission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
because it refuses to insist equally on the two
aspects of the message it has undertaken to
deliver to mankind.</p>

<p>If religion is received in a purely dogmatic
sense, it can appeal only to our emotions and to
the spiritual cravings of the more mystical side
of men’s natures. This is only confusing and
quite unsatisfying to our more rationalistic inclinations,
which prefer a simple and direct ethical
teaching. Christianity combines the two elements—the
mystical and the rational—and fuses
them together. Unfortunately there is a proneness
to detach the former as all-important and
sufficient in itself and to neglect the latter. The
former has been built up gradually in successive
centuries of varying and imaginative speculation,
and however much it may appeal to the religious-minded,
it is valueless when broken off from the
latter. The ethical precepts for duty and conduct
are, on the other hand, immutable, and in
their pristine simplicity carry all their original
force of authority and lose nothing from being
divorced from dogmatic teaching. It requires
no heights of spiritual exaltation to accept
Christ’s explicit precepts as to sacrifice, humility,
altruism, and the renunciation of worldly possessions,
but men are encouraged by the Church to
seek consolation in a fog of doctrinal obscurantism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Christ no doubt foresaw that we should take
refuge in the incomprehensible in our failure
to accept what to the humblest intelligence
was perfectly comprehensible when he said,
“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
but he that doeth the will of my Father which is
in Heaven.”</p>

<p>His immediate successors were not handicapped
by considerations for or subservience to those in
authority who held the worldly power, and they
spoke with no uncertain voice.</p>

<p>What is wanted in the Church to-day is something
of the uncompromising spirit of those bygone
days. Not condonation, or at the most half-hearted
criticism, but wholesale denunciation in
words of splendid vehemence such as the passage
in the Epistle of St. James:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for
your miseries that shall come upon you. Your
riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.
Your gold and silver is cankered; and
the rest of them shall be a witness against you,
and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have
heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold,
the hire of the labourers who have reaped
down your fields, which is of you kept back by
fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of
sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth,
and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts,
as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned
and killed the just, and he doth not resist you.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">Results of influence of money—No motive in lives of the rich—Money
as our master—If money ideal could be discarded—Possibility
of change of ideal for all classes.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Only</span> the surface of the subject has been
touched, only a few of the many heads
into which the discussion might be divided have
been considered at all, and only some of the
more patent dangers have been very briefly indicated.
But enough has been said to support
the original contention and to bring us fairly
to the conclusion that in all directions the influence
of the money possessed by individuals
beyond the limit of what constitutes a full competence
is harmful and noxious. It has a hardening,
crippling, and deadening effect on the highly
susceptible and sensitive organism of human
vitality, like varnish would have on the wings of
a butterfly. It substitutes patronage for fraternity,
arrogance for humility, indolence for effort,
vanity for love, the spirit of submission for
the spirit of independence, an artificial class
society for a natural society of mutual respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
and affection. It saps vitality by surfeit and
superabundance, and at the same time stunts
healthy development by misery and want. It is
a false and vicious standard for estimating worth.
Greed and Cupidity are its parents, Envy and
Jealousy its children.</p>

<p>But it is easier to disregard all this and to go
on in what appears to be the natural and, indeed,
inevitable course. We must take the world as it
is, is the common cry, not as it ought to be, and
unless we are prepared to be submerged and
trodden under, we must follow in the throng
and push forward and struggle with the rest.
Some of us are able to feel resentment at A’s
riches, but, alas! it is not because he is <em>rich</em>,
but because <em>he</em> is rich. It is said that the craving
to satisfy material wants is as inseparable a part
of human nature as any other appetite. This
may be so to some extent, but it is clearly a
matter of proportion. After the appetite has
reached a certain point it is no more natural
than gluttony, drunkenness, or any other form
of debauchery. In far too many cases that point
has long been passed and a state of society has
been evolved to suit the new order, and not only
to excuse, but to extol and strengthen the power
of money.</p>

<p>Let men live, whatever kind of life they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
choose, without interference, let them indulge
their hobbies and amuse themselves within
bounds; but let them recognise that there <em>are</em>
bounds, and that the inter-cohesion of the isolated
atoms in the whole mass of human life is
such that every step they take over those bounds
they are depriving someone else of living the life
<em>they</em> choose, indulging <em>their</em> hobbies, and amusing
<em>themselves</em>.</p>

<p>The rich are mostly unconscious of the harm
they are doing. There is no deliberate intention
in any of their actions. They travel carelessly
along the broad road laid down for them by
custom, and they never count the costs or examine
the consequences. Their lives, more
especially those of their women, are entirely
aimless and certainly devoid of any determined
motive. As long as they are allowed to pursue
their course undisturbed, making or spending
the money which they look on as their own in
any way that suits their fancy, they make no
complaint. They ask the State to guard them
securely in the enjoyment of their great possessions,
and they employ the energy they derive
from them in poisoning the springs of national
prosperity. The moment it is suggested that
some small share of their gains should be taken
by the State for the general benefit and for safeguarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the security of others besides themselves,
they, including even those of them who
have declared their wealth to be a burden, send
up a wail of execration and protest with all the
force they have at their command.</p>

<p>This condition of things, as it has been shown,
brings no happiness to the rich and it brings
great mischief to the State. Individual energy is
dissipated and human capacity is misapplied in a
society where effort is so ill-directed in the extremes
of riches and poverty; while the social
power of the community is wasted in a society
where capitalists control so many of the sources
of wealth.</p>

<p>Money, by convincing us of its indispensable
nature and egging us on in the scramble for more,
has, however much we may resent it, got the
upper hand and has practically enslaved us. A
comparison can be made with the modern mania
for speed. The rapidity of the means of locomotion
encourages a perpetual rush and deludes
people into supposing that the faster they go
the more they will accomplish. There is a foolish
belief that steam, electricity, and petrol have
been turned to our own use and have been
mastered, whereas these giant forces are playing
with us and stirring us, like ants in a disturbed
ant-hill, into an almost ridiculous state of flurry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
and confusion which is detrimental both to our
minds and our bodies, and the sum total of our
higher accomplishments is more likely to show a
decline than an increase from the days before
these forces were let loose. But rapid locomotion
is at present too fascinating for us to
resist. Just in the same way the allurements of
money are carrying us away down a steep incline
to unforeseen perils.</p>

<p>Where and when shall we stop? Some say
that society, having got on to this dangerous
downward slope, gradual evolution to a healthier
state is no longer possible; but, as in the case
of the abolition of slavery and the abolition of
autocracy, the change can only be brought about
by a cataclysmic upheaval. As the power of
money augments and vast riches are piled higher
and higher, it is becoming the more apparent
that an opposing force of bitter antagonism is
being created which may one day gain strength
enough to sweep away the vampire of capitalism.</p>

<p>“Wealth is in the hands of the few rich and
the suffrage in the hands of the many poor. In
the concentration of wealth and the diffusion of
political power lies the great danger of Modern
Society. The danger becomes every day greater,
and democracy, which seemed to have saved
society, is really destined to overturn it.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Perhaps it can save it by overturning it. But at
present any such danger would seem remote, as,
in spite of the great advances made by organised
Labour, the mass of the people, more especially
those herded into towns, are sadly lacking in
vitality. In the first stages of the rise of democracy
there have been thrown to the surface
men of great business ability, but of no imagination,
and firm believers in money. The process
of a deeper and more general enlightenment
must of necessity be slow.</p>

<p>On the whole, we need have no fear that
plutocracy will ever gain complete ascendancy,
even though it may have aristocracy, royalty,
and at times political power to support it. But
it is not so much the attack from without that
is likely to destroy the entrenched position of the
rich as the rot within which is steadily undermining
their stronghold with corruption and
decay.</p>

<p>A cataclysm, in the shape of a social revolution,
is too apt to lead to reaction, and the fundamental
alteration of social relations would only be delayed
thereby. This, however, in a smaller or
larger degree, is the course of advance that
progress takes. Rising, falling, and yet advancing
in a spiral shape. History never repeats itself
exactly, the path never passes over the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
point; but a cyclical resemblance occurs in the
course of events which sometimes makes us feel
we are only the sport of circumstances. And
yet at the same time, within us there seems to be
stored up a latent power strong enough to break
away and make great changes if our efforts
could only be united in sympathy and fortified
by agreement. The tendency of society may be
downward and in the wrong direction, but the
natural trend of human endeavour, free and unfettered,
is upwards towards a better state, and
there are encouraging indications that in the
future, the distant future, perhaps, this power
will prevail and we shall all unite in a better
purpose. At this moment certainly there is no
room for despair when we see around us a
growing indignation and impatience with social
injustice. Never before has humanitarian impulse
been so well fortified by scientific theory
in its attempt to cope with the evils of poverty
and destitution. All we want is an equally
scientific discernment of the evils of riches and
waste.</p>

<p>If the money ideal could only be discarded
with the same universal alacrity and conviction
with which it is now clung to and cherished, the
change and improvement in our social life would
be as miraculous and yet as natural as the change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
from the dark chill of winter to the sunshine of
spring. But it will not be by bitter vituperation
and invective that the change can be brought
about. The attack must be directed not against
particular individuals, not against isolated follies,
nor against single instances of wicked extravagance,
thoughtlessness, and cruelty, but against
the stereotyped system which is responsible for
it all. The awaking to a different faith must
take place just as much among the poor as among
the rich. The former must be taught to recognise
that cringing submission to so-called superiors
is neither to their own nor to anyone else’s
advantage; the latter must learn that to isolate
themselves in a fool’s paradise of ease and thoughtlessly
to assume impossible responsibilities is fatal
to their own happiness and to the welfare of
their fellows. And the large medium class,
who are well-to-do but not rich, living modestly
but not poor, must be shaken from their indolent
and self-complacent position of spectators
securely railed off from the arena where the
combat is taking place; thanking heaven they
are not among the victims and secretly admiring
the assailants, though proudly conscious that they
themselves can be exonerated from all blame.
There are too many in this class who, to put it
plainly, hate the poor and reverence the rich,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
and they will be the last to be reached or influenced
by the cleansing spirit of enlightened
thought.</p>

<p>Any transformation must proceed from within.
The effectual resistance to what seems to be the
compulsion of modern conventions and habits
can only arise from a clearer knowledge and a
more complete comprehension of the falseness of
these conventions and the worthlessness of these
habits. In order to combat vanity, selfishness,
and love of ease, not only a change of front and
ideal is essential, but there must also be a supreme
and sustained effort to stand up against and
head back the dead weight of opinion which
has gained impetus from never being checked.
There must be sincere and deep-seated conviction.
Without this any political or social revolution
will fail. “The mightiest changes have
come from religious and moral changes in men’s
hearts.”</p>

<p>The fervent devotion to the service of Mammon
acts as a baneful influence working havoc
and destruction in men’s lives. Instead of ignoring
or excusing it, attention must be called to
it loudly, repeatedly, and emphatically by all
who are convinced of its dangers and wish to
warn their fellows against its deadly infection.</p>
